ch_1 : Hi can you hear and see me? All right

***ch_0 : Yes, I can hear you***

ch_1 : perfect alright so let's get started. This is our first lesson together so just a quick introduction. Hi I'm shira. I'm a current student at Tulane University where I double major in finance and computer science a bit about myself is that I actually speak three languages and english was my second. So I know exactly what it's like to try and learn english and pick it up and I know that it's not easy. And a bit about my time with wrinkles that I've been with Ringo for only about a month. But I work with about four students every morning here. I'm from new york city, it's nine a.m. Right now and you're my third. So I have a bit of experience meeting with my Ringle students and they generally fall into one of three categories. One is business people, a lot of korean business people. I'm a finance student. I have interned with Bank of America Merrill and I have some corporate american hands on experience. So a lot of emails, interview prep just formal business writing, finance all under that umbrella. Next I get a lot of software developers actually and a lot of technical terminology people who need to learn how to talk about cryptocurrencies. All of that that's kind of the second more computer science like oriented group and then three students I get a lot of students because I'm a student myself I've been one for a very long time and a lot of academic writing. For korean universities in english etcetera? Generally those three But again just I'm here to help you improve your english. So before we get started I would love to hear a little bit about you and what you are looking to get out of our time together. Working with Ringle etcetera.

**ch_0 : it's interesting for you to speak to your experiencing yourself for me. Hi my name is in Hong, I live in Seoul south Korea. Even though You can speak three ranking ranking languages, I can't speak korean and english are it a bit? And I working for a korean company named SK group which is which has several visions areas such as semiconductor and refiner refinery and some internet and communication technology business ease such as telecommunication and commerce even and and we have video media business and we are also interested in Cryptocurrency. It's nice to see you and I can I hope we can have interested interesting discussion for half of the time, half an hour.**

ch_1 : That is a great introduction. Alright so I'm excited to get started. I see right here that this is a discussion focused like lessons. So there are questions about the article. Do you want to talk about them? Do you want to write them out? Do you prefer seeing the words like on a document as we talk or do you want me to just you know ask you the questions and give you some practice speaking time whatever you prefer.

**ch_0 : I'm sorry I'm still in the office. I don't because I have I still have have some work to do Even though it's over 10 p.m.**

ch_1 : it's late for you.

**ch_0 : In Korea. so can we have 20 or 25 minutes lesson with free discussion.**

ch_1 : Yes sure. We can yes we can go for as long as you'd like. The only question is would you prefer to only talk and discuss them or do you want me to type them out and write your answers as well?

**ch_0 : I hope, I think it's nice to type my answer and my my
some and you can give me some coach**

ch_1 : All right. That sounds great. So for question one
why did you choose this topic for today?

**ch_0 : I think credible is very interesting company and interesting they have they have interesting features which are very different from other companies why it was the reason why I chose this topic and and before I read before before I chose this article I had some, I I was curious that why most why Western people we're interested in energy drink, which she had a lot of caffeine and what was the symptom that people were interested in? That was why I chose this topic,**

ch_1 : Can you see the wrinkled off right now? It's on the internet browser but if I type A. B. C. Are you able to see it that on?
when you see that I basically took what you answered and just in a bit of a different more formally written in english, we can go over the wording here.
So first thing, why did you choose this topic? You start with saying I chose this topic because so I chose this topic because of my interest in Red Bulls strategy as a company strategy basically just means you know when you have a strategy it's like a plan on how you're gonna win or how you're gonna do something. Well so if let's say your you need to win the soccer game, what is your strategy? Who is going to play there? Where are you going to pass the ball? Company strategy is how are we gonna make more money and how are we going to produce this? And how are we going to tell people to buy it? So, my interest in Red Bulls strategy as a company. The next sentence is I was curious as to why Western cultures were drawn to such a highly caffeinated drink. So when someone is drawn something, when you when it draws you in there almost like attracted to, they want something there, they like something. It's let's say you are at an art gallery and one painting draws you in, that's the one painting that you're like, I want to look at that one. So you were saying why are Western cultures and people in America? why do they want to drink it? Like something that has so much caffeine. So highly caffeinated is just a drink with so much caffeine you can say the same thing does the wording for this one make sense? Do you have any questions?
Alright, that's great. So we can move on to Let's do question three. Do you regularly take energy drinks and have you found them to school?

**ch_0 : I don't regularly take a drink because I am I don't like the feeling that I'm caffeinated even though I love I love drinking coffee.
However however I don't like the feeling after I drink energy drink. I think energy drink and there's drinks or more content content ID or content concentrated.
That's why I feel uncomfortable after I drink after I drink or drink energy drink and I'm wondering how how were some people or how I rest on people Phil after drinking after drinking an energy drink.**

ch_1 : Alright, so that was a great answer. I actually have that right here. So you start by saying I don't drink energy drinks or I don't really do when you say I don't really do something, it means like maybe I've had energy drink one time but I don't do it, I don't really do it at all. So basically I don't really drink energy drinks. This is because I don't love the feeling of being caffeinated. When you say you don't love it versus you hate it or you don't like it, don't love, just means it's I don't like it that much, like it's not that good when you hate something, it's like terrible, it's like, my god, being caffeinated is the worst thing, but like when you say I don't love it, just I I prefer to not feel that. So I don't love the feeling of being caffeinated while I love the occasional cup of coffee or you can say I like the occasional cup of coffee, occasional ism sometimes here and there. So when I while I like to have coffee here and there, sometimes I avoid or stay away from energy drinks for they are far too concentrated. The concentration is more just like how much caffeine per like like bottle can or set But does the wording for this to make sense? Is there anything you want to add?
Alright, if you have any questions you can ask ahead and if not we can move to a different question. All right, alright, question five. If you had the opportunity to influence Red Bull's marketing strategy, how would you say shape its messages? That's a hard question,

***ch_0 : I think it's a it's a such a hard question***

ch_1 : you can think about it for a second too, because now you have to think about the marketing strategy.

**ch_0 : Tourism I answered it was such a hard question was the rather ball credible is very very famous for their marketing strategy for example, they follow some people to the sky. The they pursue where they show you on the show that they they pursue such a hard situation. They were such hard to her hard experience that we can we get hardly experienced. That's why I think there Mark marketing, that's that's why I think it hurt to think about their marketing strategy and I think the veritable is very famous for extreme sports
and I don't think about I haven't think I haven't thought about any strategy for them?**

ch_1 : Alright, that's actually very fair. This is one of the harder questions I've seen Ringo put up but I'll actually give you an answer that I was thinking about this when I saw this, I was like, my God, this is a crazy question. Here's one of the things that stood out to me when I was reading the article at the very end it says in fact Red Bull is a rebranded soda with more caffeine starring B vitamins. Most of the energy the beverage claims to give you comes from the mix of sugar and a high dose of caffeine The added benefit of those two together is questionable, so basically says Red Bull is just soda with more caffeine. So they gave you coca cola, put a little bit more sugar in it and coca cola already has a ton of sugar and put caffeine in it. And then they said when you mix it together, they called it energy, what is energy? It's probably not good for you, but we don't ask questions. It's energy. I think that if I were to have to come in In 2022 and talk about marketing strategy, one of the things I'd want to say is differentiate Red bull from soda because at the end of the day, Red bull is soda with caffeine. But as a marketer for Red Bull, I would say no we have to create energy as a different category. It's not soda. So if I were to redevelop Red Bulls marketing strategy, that's just how you can start the sentence. I would create an emphasis on it. the differentiation Energy drinks. And so I would create an emphasis on the differentiation is it's the idea, it's a concept, it's a noun and it's the idea that things are different. The differentiation between american and british accents is the idea that they sound different. It's not the one word that they sound different but british people sound different. There's a differentiation So the differentiation between energy drinks and sodas bread full is a well is essentially I'll use out living there essentially a glorified can of okay, so with an extra joe's of caffeine and that and any new strategy and actually I would say and I would focus on reassuring consumers. continue we're leaving. there is more to the energy drink then just that this is a long sentence. We'll go over it. I began by saying Red bull is essentially the idea of essentially his own. Maybe not exactly but overall the idea of it so not exactly but red bull is essentially a glorified can of coca cola glorified is like people think it's better People say it's better. We say it's a different and amazing but it's not. So red bull is essentially coca cola bye with an extra dose of caffeine in there. All it is is coca cola and then you put a bit more coffee. So I would focus on my my marketing strategy reassuring when you reassure someone it's almost like calm them down and confirm that there. Right? So reassure consumers keep believing or continue to continue believing that there's more to red bull than just a bit more caffeine because otherwise they'll just have coca cola and coffee but you need to create the idea that red bull is special. That it's not just coca cola with coffee in there. But I would work on doing more. Does that make sense? The english in there? I know it was a I wrote a higher level response for it.

***ch_0 : I'm trying to understand***

ch_1 : Do you have any questions about any of the words on the dock here. I have it all written out.

**ch_0 : Actually, I don't have any question related to related with your answer or your feedback and I am wonder, I am wondering you are you, are you enjoying, are you enjoying drinking**

ch_1 : Never. Never. I don't even think I've ever had a Red Bull. I like coffee. I really like coffee. I have like wanted to have an espresso machine so I drink a lot of coffee but never Red bull, never energy drinks. My mom, when I was growing up was a dietician and she was very careful with what we ate and I always, one time I tasted it when I left home I was an adult, I was like I was never allowed to have these. Let me try and it tastes like chemicals. Just like drinking chemicals. And I was like, I'm never having this again so I don't drink it. But I like the caffeine if you want caffeine. I I think drink coffee.
Alright let's do at least one more question before. If you need to head out early you can
Question two Actually is a good one. What did you learn from this article?

***ch_0 : Actually, I didn't, I didn't read the article so***

ch_1 : Okay, we can switch from that. We can switch to a different one.
Let's see honestly this is such a weird like I'm looking at the questions. These aren't good. Is there anything you'd want to discuss then? That's not about Red Bull. Is there anything related to your work? You'd want to have
You'd wanna word or if you want to even just tell me about your day so we can get a little bit more speaking time in there before you head out.

**ch_0 : Actually, probably when we started the restaurant, I was wondering that, wow, Other two languages so you can speak**

ch_1 : okay. So I my first language was hebrew, my mom is from Argentina, my dad is from Israel, so I born in new york city, learned hebrew before english until I was five When I was five I started English and when I was 12 I think 11, I started French also and I'm now fluent in french and now we do spanish now my mom from Argentina, she's like you need to speak spanish, so going on number four, but I only know a little bit of spanish.

**ch_0 : actually when I was young I heard that people who are his hebrew or should it be your own people should be, should be that their mother should be hebrew, it is true,**

ch_1 : Yes, that's in Judaism, yes, so that's actually that's not the language or Israel, but that's more the religion and Judaism. So in Christianity it the dad is christian then the kid is christian, that's how it works
in Judaism, it's the opposite. If you are only jewish according to religion, if your mom was, so if the mom is not jewish you're not, so if you have christian dad and a jewish mom then the kid is both. But if you have a jewish dad and fresh teen mom then the kid is neither because it has to be the mom And so they're opposites, but that's actually true, does that make sense?

**ch_0 : actually I was wondering why is why people think actually, I think Origen originated the reason why it works,**

ch_1 : It's the religion. I don't I honestly, I might have heard it. I might actually look into it now that I'm thinking I know it's always been religion
but I don't know if there's a
I don't know it just I think it talks about like it just talks about the idea that it's passed down by the mother and not the father. That's it. I don't know. I don't think it's real crazy reason.
But that's actually interesting. I never really thought about that. You have anything else? You want to talk about any other questions before we wrap up?

**ch_0 : no, and actually I wanna, I want to tell you that I am so sorry if you feel any inconvenience**
