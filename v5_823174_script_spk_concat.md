ch_1 : that's what you procrastinate.
Sometimes I will procrastinate like going to the gym
so it's better for me. Like it's very it's good if I go to the gym or exercise in the morning, right? Because
then I finish and I don't I don't think about it all day long but if I
if I don't exercise in the morning or go to the gym or you know, do something physical then then I'm procrastinating all day and I sometimes I don't do it right?
So that that's something difficult for me,

***ch_0 : Do you like exercising?***

ch_1 : yes, and I feel better, like it makes me calmer and I feel like I feel less anxious if I'm able to exercise, but I don't I don't prioritize it, you know?
So these days a bit more like in the summertime it's more it's easier, but
while I'm working at school, it's like it's more difficult.
So and I really, I think it's good to do things in the morning, you know, like some people, they like to wake up very early and exercise or I don't know, do something and I like this. Like I like to do things in the morning and then the rest of the day I can feel more,
I feel free free or more free,

and I don't want to do this, like I'm procrastinating,
I don't want to call the bank, so
So I don't know if I if I don't call the bank before lunch then I don't think it's going to happen in the afternoon.
Yes. That's another thing. I think I procrastinate a lot anything with the bank like going to the bank in person. I don't like it. So
I don't like going to the bank.

**ch_0 : Do you have in your region, do you have an annual meeting?
Do you have any religions? Do do do you have any religion? You don't like to go banking.**

ch_1 : I don't know. I prefer like I can do some things online. So the things I can do online is nice but
if I have to go in person or I have to make a phone call
it makes it a little bit more like or I don't want to do it. So

**ch_0 : Problem. then in spine line banking, each online banking is possible, possible easily.**

ch_1 : in yes. online banking. Like I do mostly everything online. Sometimes I have to do something in person. But I'm trying to do more and more things online because it's a lot easier.

I also to try to get.**

ch_1 : Do you do you go to the bank sometimes you have to go in person like

**ch_0 : I almost I almost do my with my smartphone.
And just if you click click old mouse
with the computer and we don't need, I don't need to go banking at her. But but when we moved to another city then we have got a loan. Get along. And then**

ch_1 : And you have to go in person for the loan.

**ch_0 : and then we have to meet me in person cause banking bang bank employee.**

ch_1 : I called, I called the bank, I called the bank last week or two weeks ago and they told me something about coming in person and I said no
like no I want to do everything online or somehow on the phone like tell me tell me what I have to do to do this on the phone because it's like the orders like online is okay on the phone. It's okay but it's not my favorite and then going in person
is like absolutely not please no.

**ch_0 : nothing. Yes. next week, next week, next week our class we can do take rest without our dollars so you don't worry.**

ch_1 : no, maybe maybe next week they will stay up even later.
They will continue to stay up until
if mommy if mommy is awake then they stay awake. Right?
I remember when I was a child
it was like, I remember as a child, me and my my sister and my cousins when I when we were together with my cousins, we would stay up very late and my mom like my mom would be following us and
and getting really angry like go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
but it was it was like a lot of Children like me and my sister
and my cousins, you know like we were probably six or seven Children.
So a lot of Children. Yes altogether.

***ch_0 : Including your, your cousin,***

ch_1 : And we didn't sleep.

***ch_0 : your mother, your mommy was super mom.***

ch_1 : My mom, my mom and my aunt and they told us, you know go to sleep like go to sleep.

**ch_0 : Wow. Then then do they go to three without their parents?**

ch_1 : Yes. Or sometimes we would like stay, stay in each other's houses. You know like the
My cousins come to my house and stay stay two nights or three nights. And
and the moms, the moms, it was always sometimes the dads, the dads were a lot, we were scared when it was the dads.
So first the moms and then if the dad's had to come to tell us to be quiet then
it was a bit a bit more serious. But
and we were we were excited to be together because you know, we didn't live very close to my cousins. So the times when we were together it was like exciting and the Children, they get really excited and
so it's a good memory.

***ch_0 : Yes, it's very interesting.***

ch_1 : So I have to say to my, to my mom now like remember remember when you had to tell me to go to sleep all the time and

***ch_0 : Then then is your mom remember for now?***

ch_1 : yes, yes, she's going to remember. Yes,
she she likes these memories now. She's a bit my mom is a bit sad because
because her Children are big, you know like the Children, like we are old. She likes to have small Children. She misses having having small Children.
Like she was very happy when we were four years old and two years old and six,
now she is sad and she wants a grandchild.

**ch_0 : no. I also start to my the most free can't stay like this little bad. Please go bad. Not, not not we come please go to bed. parenting is very challenging but is partially in night night very difficult because we have to we have to make them go to go to sleep. every mother's is. Nice. I think because I am a mother too without any patience and love we can glaze them I think.**

ch_1 : And I remember like you go the Children, the child goes to sleep and they say like, I'm thirsty, I want water and you say, okay, here's water
and the next thing, I have to go to the bathroom, okay, go to the bathroom
and then like I'm cold, I need I need another blanket. So okay, you need another blanket,
maybe an extra pillow
and then like an animal or something, the stuffed animal. So

**ch_0 : Then mom was getting getting, we can be me. We can be a monster. They when they when they leave class over and over again than like thirsty and like this cold and I need some do doors not not maybe more just fair. What can I what can I do? What can I do?
You just need to sleep? no mom. No I can't.
I don't need I don't want then I can be a monster.**

ch_1 : maybe you need like a medicine or a pill or something.
You give the little pill to the child and it makes them sleepy.
or like an on and off switch, you know, like the lights or like your your computer, you can turn the computer off and it's finished
for the day. Maybe we need this for Children like off.
Okay, so there's one more question that
what are the drawbacks? The drawbacks are benefits of early planning.
So what do you do you like to plan a lot or?

**ch_0 : If we if I plan in other bands then first of all I can impact what will happen,
what is happening. So in other words I am able to be careful is culturally on emergency occasions. First we don't we don't need to be embarrassed embarrassed because we get already ready to or head any situation.
Yes. So in troubling when traveling other countries and it's it can be a middle accord. Of course.
So if I situations that which which are on expected so we can that's what that
she bites, she bites me.**

ch_1 : She bid you. no.

**ch_0 : North so so we prepare you know the best and the was married is not not be embarrassed I think. we can impact what what were happening.**

ch_1 : but you said to that when you travel, you don't like to plan everything right? When you travel, you like to to have some flexibility and it's nice if you don't plan everything, then you can, if you are very tired, you can rest. Or maybe if you feel like doing lots of things then you can do a lot of things. But
I like to plan in advance. But also I like to
to have, I like spontaneous things as well. So

**ch_0 : and sometimes too much planning can be we work, we work and
later of course chorus.
So Sometimes not planning can be a good experience because we can't hear Can't fear. You can feel amazing. Amazing.**

ch_1 : And maybe if you plan a lot, then maybe you are disappointed because if you plan many things and then something happens differently than maybe you are disappointed. But
I think it's important to to be open minded or something to be open minded and flexible.
So sometimes I'm very very frustrated with my boyfriend because my boyfriend doesn't plan like me.
So I plan, I plan more
and he doesn't, so sometimes he can tell me, like, he tells me a week before, like, I'm I'm going out of town,
like I'm traveling next week to see my friends and I get really angry, very angry, like.
Yes. Yes, because there we don't have, we don't have Children, but we have a dog, so,
you know, you have to plan and think about the dog and

***ch_0 : You have to you have to prepare for your dog.***

ch_1 : or maybe, yes, sometimes, like sometimes I open the food, like the dog food
and there's no food or the bag inside the bag, there's no dog food and I get very angry, like
you have to plan and buy the dog food before,

**ch_0 : command. in north Korea is very late late at night

So what time, what time do the girls wake up, your daughters, do they wake up very early or they sleep a lot?

**ch_0 : They go they go to the kindergarten and they care so they wake up almost eight 88 A. M.**

ch_1 : Are they tired? Or they, it's okay, like they sleep for eight hours and

**ch_0 : higher because before before the day they when they go to bed late
then of course they feel very tired. Next the next thing.**

ch_1 : in the morning and they cry and things?

**ch_0 : mom I I don't want to go to back and I don't want you to go kindergarten and daycare. I just
I will be at home with you.
