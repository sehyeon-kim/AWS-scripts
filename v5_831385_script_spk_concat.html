before but it's too hard to hit the ball because when I hit the ball
it's kind of like</strong></p>

interested in playing table tennis with my</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Nice. So alright let's let's have a look at these grand slams. so that is interesting. Why did you choose this specific topic if you never</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : actually I like watching, Sports. Broad sports, especially soccer, baseball and basketball.
some popular sports but I haven't interested in tennis before because they're I think because there was not world class players in Koreans. However some
co workers have studied to play tennis after work and literally I also became interested in tennis
in that reason for the legion I want to learn chinese more. And through the article I kill a history of tennis and I was a little surprised that tennis has a longer history than I thought.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : No, to that. All right, cool, cool. Now, okay, before before reading the article,
what did you know about tennis?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I just know some famous tennis players, loser feathers
I and I like because she is very pretty.
that's right. And I just know knew about and I just knew some Grand Slam competition. Wimbledon and us but I don't know, I didn't know Australian and Australia and paris open before.
I I think I think three players, three famous players very,
what can I say?
Losers, Federer, another Djokovic are very
performance for long time. I think maintaining for four months longer is very
So I respect them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>ch_0 : I think he's very amazing. I
while I'm watching the
video I think he lost his point but he overcome some
difficult situation and get the point.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I think it's really amazing like the their endurance because
they are running around for like 2.5 to 3 hours
and like the amount of leg strength it takes to be able to do that because the swing is more I think more about like it's kind of like a golf swing,
you can learn the right fluid movement
and so you don't have to exert a lot of energy for the swing. It's more about
the technique, I should say the technique
but their legs man, they actually say that tennis players have like the strongest legs even more than some football players
Because they are unbelievably like they're always having to bend down to
hit the ball and running around so much so it's it's really amazing.</p>

<p>ch_1 : Okay. Okay my bad. Maybe I misread that article then.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : is their favorite soccer tim
Take do you like watching soccer and</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I like I like football also.
I I would say
maybe in my favorite team would be probably real Madrid.
because it was like the first team that I really started to support.
I always used to watch
football growing up because my dad really loves football too. And
but when I was a little bit older maybe
because you know in the in the U. S. Basketball is also very popular. So I played more
basketball and volleyball you know then football. But then
when I after I graduated and I was in university that's when I really started to be more
into into football again. And when I graduated
I moved back home with my parents and I was like obsessed with football. It was like my whole life,
my whole life was just football. It was like all I did, all I did was go to work
and then after work I would run like like super fast to the area where the guys used to play, they used to have a meet and you know in san Diego the the weather is very beautiful almost every day it's like
So every day people are playing football.
So and I would leave work from like maybe
5:30 and I would just run over there and we played from like 6-9 every single day. And then on Saturdays I played with another group of guys
And we used to play from like 1-4. I was so obsessed with football for like
maybe two years. Like a year and a half, two years.
No more actually like almost three years, three years. but I loved it and it was it was really great because
it really taught me a lot though also about my body
like you know because I would think about a lot more
like I would wake up on saturday and I'll be thinking okay I'm gonna play at one so I should eat something now and give my body time to like digest a little bit so I don't feel heavy you know during trying to run.
And it was it was really it was nice. I miss I miss those days. But</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : how about plays that people again?</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I haven't played in a long time but I would like to play actually I would I would love to play to be honest.
I still have my I have my indoor indoor football shoes football
because I think in europe it's more like
football is more pop is more popular.
I mean you can find maybe in the UK for example, you could probably find
Pitches for full 11, 11 aside,
but here in the Czech Republic football is not the most popular sports, like
the second probably the second most popular, maybe even the third most popular sport because they love hockey
and maybe I would say cross like winter sports, like cross country skiing.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : it's very different. To</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Yes, for sure wish for is there is there any sport that you would have liked to have played that you don't that you don't play?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : recently I just play soccer and
if I get a chance I want to long golf because
in my ages and older ages usually,
and in company, many coworkers or so say communicate about golf.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : thanks. I was reading that golf has become is becoming very popular in Korea.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : but basically I was, I think I'm bad that kind of sports. I mean, I, I'm good at sports
using my leg. learning</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : that's true. Golf is a very, very different type of sport. That's true.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : yes it is. That's right,</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : It's well good that man, I mean sport, I think all sports are good no matter, you know,
it's also like about the mental side of it, it's really
it's good for you. So
Okay, there was a few things that I marked down here
just kind of some expression, different expression, all ways of saying things,
but the one that I wanted to,
so the one that I think I'll send it to you is the preposition, there's one website that I found
that has really good
Has really good explanation about about when to use and how to use some of the prepositions
and then and then I noticed a few times that when you were speaking about the past, you were using the present tense verb just to remember that, you know if you speak about the past, just tried to remember always to pick
the past tense verb.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Okay. Okay. I see.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : good, good stuff. But I like your, I like how you're mixing the, you know, good transition words, transition phrases, so that's that's really good.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Thank you. Thank you.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : like actually it's good, you don't use it too much to like the same ones too often. I think
sometimes people, I find that like people tend to use the same ones they feel comfortable with, so they always say like,
you know, so or therefore therefore therefore, but it's good to
mix up your language, you know, just to try
new things and that's always good.
So any any questions about anything?
awesome. Okay. well what about, Okay, so the four, the four grand slams that are speaking more about tennis,
the you know, which would you say, which is your favorite grand slam, which do you think is the most exciting?</p>

Should have been a dentist player.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : but but in tennis,
three players is our kind of high work. Maybe.
every time winner is</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : those three Exactly, that's true. It's like a monopoly, it's like google and

<p>ch_1 : The doll, I guess Nadal played fritz. Who did?

He was down two games and when he came back
And won the last three. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : and and I heard that very interested story. To Covid's
didn't attend, didn't attend or sit in the open because
he was not vaccinated. So</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : interesting. What do you know why he didn't want to get vaccinated?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I don't know. I think he I I think he just to don't believe effective vaccine worse he operates some side effects may be.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I mean, if I was an athlete, I wouldn't get it either. I mean, these guys are in like the best shape of anyone on the planet, you know, I don't think you need any,
your immune system is so strong,
just kill any virus.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I agree with you.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : But but that's pretty big news though because I mean, he could have maybe one, he's he's giving up a lot of money by not going to the
to that tournament, but
I guess he doesn't really need any more money. I think he's okay.
man, now, which which round of the tournament are they in?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Maybe semi final go to semifinal.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : And today, today Nadal is gonna play fritz.</p>

<p>ch_1 : right. I mean, what is it about Nadal that you like over the other two?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : because because of the Youtube video on ringo site.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Right. Nice. Okay. He's I mean he's amazing player and he's definitely the best. I don't know if he's still the best clay player, but he always used to be the best clay player because
I think one of the spanish tournaments is played on clay,
and he used to practice a lot on clay, so he's very good at that surface,</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : paris open before. and paris</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : This is a clear. Okay, thanks.
