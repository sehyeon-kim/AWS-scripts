ch_1 : awesome. And have you been learning for a while?

**ch_0 : by myself after third the university during the, during walking I

ch_1 : very cool, awesome. Okay for today's lesson just to make sure would you prefer a more paraphrasing style where you answer and then I rephrase your answers or just a discussion where we talk and I give you feedback at the end
awesome then I can totally do that.

**ch_0 : because I don't know much a lot about the particularly
so it's good for me two If you can use the native speakers for capability or question**

ch_1 : sure. would you prefer more just like sounding more natural or more formal vocabulary?
Natural. Okay awesome. Then I can totally do that. So let's get started for the first question what do you like or dislike about Pixar's corporate culture as it is described in the article.

**ch_0 : like pixie fix such corporate culture because as you know in general manufacturing company like the Samsung has just some strict polish for the security and the way we are working together but in case the picture pixel because the pixels the animations to deal to need to, I wanted to have some credit creativity so fixer operate their company with some freedom for their employees to think about and make something and invented your team extremely if I can work in picks up then I can in more, I can be happier than now.**

ch_1 : So right now you don't have a chance to be creative in your work.

***ch_0 : I follow just my post***

ch_1 : and if you could be more creative I guess what what what kind of environment would you prefer if you could be creative?

**ch_0 : bear in mind. Okay, content service because I like watching movie so someday I wanted to make movie or some make a relationship between the movie studios
and it's just something
I'll just to make a movie with my creativity.**

ch_1 : very cool. Do you are you a big fan of movies.
What's your favorite movie?

**ch_0 : I love Disney or Pixar movie because they have a very famous characters and I love you those kind of ideas because for example in marvel movie they expanded their word. They can expand their scenarios with just one character. of history
did Ginny or pixel can make another story with the boat or maybe with some solo capers it is more difficult.
Make another story with one character better than make something useful with nuclear**

ch_1 : it's more difficult to make a story about the new, the old character than the new character.
Why do you think that?

**ch_0 : because I just use your one character I think I can have some limitation because I needed to describe the those cakes take test or some background story
then sometimes I can
been to some limitation to expand the story. Already you could just,**

ch_1 : Okay that makes sense, I understand what you mean by that. Okay, I'll go ahead and paraphrase these just so you know it is american independence Day and so if you hear booming in the background people are lighting fireworks.
So sorry about that.

**ch_0 : Actually my family wanted to see the fireworks outside.
but because I on the video tape
tell the story to my family commit
opportunity, putting their heads together.**

ch_1 : they, my city held a big fireworks show and it's kind of still going on a little bit.
Okay and I will go ahead and paraphrase and I'll explain what I'm the things I'm changing and what I'm doing as I go
here rather than in general, another vocabulary word you can use is generally
because and here rather than companies singular, you want to make company plural. So companies as if you're talking about something in general,
that means that it talks about multiple things. So you're gonna want companies plural. Manufacturing companies like Samsung usually before proper announce, we don't use the, so before names of things like Samsung or a city name like san Jose you don't need the before it
me. So rather than the Simpson just Simpson, I was usually policies is plural because most places don't only have one policy, they have multiple,
so has strict policies for security. here where you say the way we are working together one word you can use to describe all of this is collaboration. So just to keep it more concise, I'm going to change the way we are working together to collaboration. you're going to start a new sentence and rather than use, but I'm gonna start with however, so it sounds this is a little more formal, but it's also just a way to keep your sentences from continuing on endlessly.
so however here you can I'm going to keep your same phrasing because Pixar is an animation studio here, you can also say if you want due to the nature of Pixar's work, you heard this kind of phrasing before due to the nature of
okay, so this is sort of use, it's a phrase used to describe the kind of work that a place does. So nature of work just means the type of work.
So Pixar's nature of work is animation and this nature of work requires creativity, collaboration, which is what you're describing.
So you can say however, due to the nature of Pixar's work rather than they want to have some creativity because you can even go as far as saying it's crucial, you know this word crucial.
Okay, so crucial just means absolutely important, necessary, like it's needed.
So in terms of Pixar, creativity is very important. So it's almost needed. great creativity is important. here where you say with some freedoms with their employees, I would change this to instead of saying with both times you could say they operate their company to allow terribly firm creative freedom, you know this term?
Okay, awesome. so in this case since you're talking about you, you quite literally say freedom. so just to combine, you can say to allow creative freedom to their employees do you know this word cultivate?
Okay awesome, then I'm going to get rid of your soul because I'm starting a new sentence, so just start off with it if I and in this case since you're talking about a potential thing in the future, you want to use future tense. So rather than you can, you can say it could, so if I could work at five changed would too Again can, because to keep the tense consistent if you have could you need wood so that they're both in that future tense. Does this make sense? Any questions

***ch_0 : No it's perfect for me.***

ch_1 : awesome. Okay I'm gonna skip this next one cause it's pretty short, so I'm gonna just move on to, I love Disney Pixar movies or I can paraphrase this one really quickly. Want to work in content service, hear what you say, I like watching movie I'm gonna change this to, I really what have you heard this term like greatly enjoy,
Okay awesome, it's just a little more emphasis on how much you like it rather than just I like I greatly enjoy means you really like.
So because I greatly enjoy movies

***ch_0 : Sorry I cannot whatever your post***

ch_1 : sorry, I was just reading along as I was typing, I'll explain
you can stay out of my own ideas, you can also start using wrong place out of So here I didn't change much, I just made your sentence a full sentence, so I would like to work in content service and like I said, because I greatly enjoy movies
and here because we're already talking about reasoning rather than saying because again, I just have an aunt, so and I would like to again because we're keeping it in that same tense that I would like, you want to keep the same, I would like you can say I want as well, that's fine and also say would work any of those are fine. I would want and here I want to make something like make a movie that is with my own idea, just to make that a little more concise. I just put that all into one phrase, which is just I want to create something out of my own ideas. You can also say create something using my own ideas. Does this make sense? Any questions?
Okay, awesome, then I'll do the next. Okay, here, make sure and this is a bit of a common thing if you're talking about multiple things, make sure you make them plural.
So add that? S onto the end rather than just I love Disney and Pixar movie. I love Disney and Pixar movies
because there you go. you can say famous, you can also say well known were well loved. Have you heard a term like this? Well loved?
Like this, this word.
Okay, awesome. Well in this case, since Disney characters are really well known by the public and people, well, they like them a lot. They hold a lot of personal sentiment. You can say well loved
well loved famous characters and I boy. where you say, I love those kinds of ideas and say I enjoy the view. I love those kinds of ideas just to be more specific. I would say that you enjoy the ideas behind their films because what you're talking about here is how they can develop them, how they can develop their characters, not the actual messages in the movie. And if you just say, I love the ideas that could mean anything, any of those things. So to make it more specific, you can say I enjoy the ideas behind their films and using this phrase, the behind something doesn't literally mean, you know behind
it means the people who make it, the people who create it something that's underneath the surface.
Does that make sense?
Okay, awesome. Okay, more floaties again. Make sure you pluralized movies. and just to give you another option to say, can you can also say are able to okay, means the exact same thing. Just another way to say it are able to expand the scenarios and hear what you say with just one character.
to sound more natural, you can say each individual character
that means you're talking about multiple characters, but they can they expand each character lump, so it kind of encompasses everything you're trying to say. So each individual character since you already said for example, I'm going to choose just to say also instead rather than repeating for example, hear what you're saying, They can make another story a lot of times if a company makes a story out of the character, that's not part of the main franchise. So like when they make a movie about Buzz Lightyear, that's not a Toy Story movie, you can call that a side story, have you heard this term before?
Okay, so Disney can develop a side story, so side story just means exactly what I just described when you take a character that's part of this group and make them their own thing.

**ch_0 : and I can I say the extra story other than anxiety story is the same as the extra story.**

ch_1 : extra story may mean that it's part of the main toy Story storyline,
whereas side story means it's separate from Toy Story,
but it's still about the character,
they made a little different things. Extra story is okay though, it is a thing just in this sense. side story is a bit better, feeling
okay, Disney can develop a side story with. Here, because we're transitioning into your opinion, I'm gonna add, and I think just to make it clear that it's your opinion,
I think that this one I'm going to use the same word developed just for consistency, because we're still talking about the same thing, I think it is more difficult to develop size stories on yes. then,
brand new story, there we go. keeping that same phrasing, developing side stories this phrase here, already existing rather than saying like make another story with one character rather than make something with a new character here, you're talking about, I assume characters that already exist, characters that are in movies have storylines already, is that what you mean?
Okay, so in this case you can say already existing and that means what it sounds like. These are characters that already exist. So you're saying it's more difficult to develop stories and already existing characters than it is to create a brand new story in character, do you know this term? Brand new?
Okay, then in this case, since you're talking about making something completely from scratch, you can say brand new, which means like super super new. But not much else to change there, is this? Okay, any questions?

***ch_0 : I know it's good.***

ch_1 : Okay, awesome, then I'll do this last one. Okay, in this case I'm gonna change this to what's called passive tense, which means that nobody in particular is doing the action. since you're not the one making the movie, since it's anybody could be making the movie instead of using I I'm gonna change it, so there's nobody doing anything, so if just one this is called passive tense and like I mentioned since there's no I there's no you know, we nothing like that, it's just the action was done by somebody we don't know, but like that's the idea behind it is nobody in particular is doing it, It could be anyone. And since you're talking about a general subject, it could be anybody. So that's why I chose to use this tense. Okay, if just one character is used And So here with this sentence to make it a little more concise what you mean, I used a few different words that mean the things that we're describing. So the character's backstory a lot of times, background story is just shortened into backstory
and incorporating and expanding their characteristics. So that's pretty much this whole sentence where you say sometimes I can build some limitation to expand the story that is already existing. So what you're saying is there would be difficulty with expanding that story that's already established. And so you would have difficulty with incorporating, which means just to bring in everything that's already there and expanding on it to make something new, which is why I chose the words incorporating and expanding, does that make sense? Any questions?

***ch_0 : No I don't have questions.***

ch_1 : Okay, awesome. Then ask the next one. Well you actually kind of already answered that so I'm gonna skip question too.

***ch_0 : The rescue station please.
let's go next question.***

ch_1 : okay, I'm going to go to question four because you already kind of answered questions two and three,
seven. Can you think of a case in which you referenced another company's handling of an issue? To resolve your company's issue? What can one company learn from others?

***ch_0 : that a difficult question but I let me try.***

ch_1 : Sure. If you'd like to do another one, we can do that too.

***ch_0 : I want another one.***

ch_1 : Do you think there are pros and cons related to Pixar's collaborative environment?

**ch_0 : That's the question. Bye.
I did all the pixels collaborative environment. But I think there are four cent cons about that firstly. I think that fixes collaborative environment can make people work to together because pixels give each person or responsibility all responsibilities to create to create their sections. Hefter gathering there. Each person president the jet fix that can make harmony between each Artworks to make one story lines. The I think those collaborative environment can make us some cons when we work together because for example if someone It's not good after related skin and those people can build that is not people six a smoke and
not much better than than others. So I think if I have a good skill and I am a best animator in pixels that is the best place to work but otherwise it is not difficult, it is difficult to survive in.**

ch_1 : Okay, right, what about, would you worry about others? feeling as though they're falling behind and maybe being jealous of somebody else that they work with,
Would you talk about that?
could you like talk about that? How you feel about that?

**ch_0 : when in this situation
in the same song I can have the same experience like that.
because as a you know the company wanted to make us some great for the itchy influence so someone get the high score and he can get a from others. So so it is not good for collaborative culture to make a collaborative culture if you company make great to every influence.**

ch_1 : so it's like competition?
and you don't like this Competition?

***ch_0 : I like this in mind.***

ch_1 : Do others like the competition? No Then why do you think Samsung still does it if nobody likes it?

**ch_0 : because it is easier to define the annual wage.
when that company needed to increase the way to put all employees,
if the decided the wage based on the, wow the church people can cut the total already because**

ch_1 : so it's not for the employee benefit? It's for the company benefits?

***ch_0 : I think the best.***

ch_1 : Okay, that's not good, I don't like that. How long have they done this?
How long have they used this system?

***ch_0 : 13 years. So I'm very familiar with that.***

ch_1 : Okay wow, that seems like a hard environment to work in? I'm sorry,

**ch_0 : Where if when you think about the company, which company is best for you, They're very competitive. MS. Or some very apparent the company.**
