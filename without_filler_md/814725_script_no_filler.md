**ch_1 : <Mhm> Nice**
**ch_0 : Well Korea melons.**
**ch_1 : korean melons.**
ch_0 : <Yeah> so it's like a melon but it's like yellow if it's right.
ch_1 : Okay. I don't think I've tried that one.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : I love melons. I have two melon plants in my garden. But so far they're not doing, they're not there. They're still really small.
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : They haven't produced any fruit yet. <Um> I don't know why they're just so slow. <Um> But my squash is and my pumpkins are growing really well. I don't know why the melons are having trouble. <Um> But I'm still learning so maybe I made a mistake. I don't know.
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : My garlic is doing well. You know harvest garlic
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : later this month?**
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : And my tomatoes are doing well too.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah> that's great.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> And <uh> what else? What have you been reading any new books completely.
ch_0 : No I guess I haven't really read any books since like I don't like a month or two.
**ch_1 : <Oh> no.**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Do you have a list of books that you want to read?
**ch_0 : Not really.**
ch_1 : What was the last book that you read?
ch_0 : <Uh> It was for it was just for homework about like economy.
ch_1 : It was just like a school book,
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : have you have there been any books that you really want to read or that you'd be interested to read like when you have more time?
ch_0 : <Um> No not really.
ch_1 : <Yeah> I <uh> I've been rereading a book that I read before but <um> I started reading it again. It's this book, It's called the 5th season. It's really amazing.
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : Maybe one of the best books I've ever read.
**ch_0 : that's**
ch_1 : Well definitely one of the best, but maybe the best <um>
**ch_0 : thank you.**
ch_1 : really really really good,
**ch_0 : Right.**
ch_1 : kind of interesting take on like science fiction,
ch_0 : <Oh> what is it about?
ch_1 : it's about it's kind of a hard story to say. <Um> It follows two women and one of them is a woman who just found her son murdered and she knows that her husband killed her son.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : Okay. So she's basically going to she's going to hunt her husband
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : because she knows that he killed her,
**ch_0 : <Um>**
**ch_1 : their child. And**
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : the other woman has kind of like magic powers. But in this world, the world of the story, people have magic powers that relate to the earth. So they can control things like earthquakes or volcanoes, they can control the temperature <um> but limited to that they can't fly or you know, travel through time or something. They can just use the earth's energy to do certain things. And so the story follows her and in this world, even though people have magic powers, the people who have the magic powers are kept as slaves. So they don't have freedom. They're basically forced by the people who are not magic to work. <Um> and you know, they have the power to change the earth so they can make things like earthquakes happen or not happen.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : And what's really interesting in this story is that it's set 10, maybe 40,000 years in the future. So it imagines Earth, but far, far, far in the future after Earth has gone through many cycles of change. <Um> you know, we have four seasons,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : but the fifth season in this book is the apocalypse season, basically it's in this world there's some there's always a time that comes where
**ch_0 : No**
ch_1 : because of some change in the earth <uh> like it becomes like apocalyptic or like you know what apocalyptic means.
**ch_0 : okay.**
ch_1 : Do you know what that word means?
**ch_0 : <Um>**
ch_1 : Like the end of the world.
**ch_0 : Carmen? <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> And so in the society or the culture of this world, the people are all prepared for the world to end at any time. So
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : basically they live in a state of constant preparation for The 5th season where they might have to survive for for years without food and water, they have enough supply to help them survive for years. <Um> but at the beginning of this book, there's a kind of an event that happens caused by one of these people whose a magic using slave to basically make the world end completely like every few decades or every 100 years, there's a season where maybe people will have to survive for several years without without being able to grow food or without being able to get fresh water, they might have to live underground but eventually the season will end and people will return to normal. But at the beginning of this book one of the characters destroys like the world basically and makes it impossible for humans to survive. And so the characters are living right after he does this and trying to survive. <Um>
**ch_0 : okay.**
ch_1 : It's a really really good book.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <Yeah> Do you do you like science fiction?
ch_0 : <Um> <Yeah> it's <yeah> it's okay Just okay
**ch_1 : <Yeah> just okay**
ch_0 : I just like fiction books.
ch_1 : you just like fiction like normal drama stories.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : What was the last good book that you read that you remember?
ch_0 : Well I I don't really no the <uh> title in english. <Um> So it was okay. It was it's a book <um> that was written by tim bowler.
**ch_1 : <Mm> Tim bowler?**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : But it's like <um> '00 midgets it's called. <Yeah>
**ch_1 : Midget called Midget,**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : what did you like about it?
ch_0 : Well this is a fiction book not not science fiction was just fiction.
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So it was just really interesting about the story like what happens in it. So it was really unreal but still I I just liked it.
ch_1 : That sounds cool. What was can you explain the story to me?
ch_0 : <Um> Well also this midget is a boy that has this
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : what do you say like he's too small
ch_1 : <Mhm> He's a midget.
**ch_0 : for his <yeah>**
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : he is too small for his age and he can't really speak.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : So his brother**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <um> about a few years older <um> keeps like hitting him and hitting him really hard and like putting him in some kind of like rear house or something. And so
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : and one day there's like this yacht competition where his majesty brother usually takes first place
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <um> goes there and thinks about his brother like <um> hitting a rock or something and waves going only to his brother's boat. So he thinks about it and then that actually happens and then in other competitions that keeps happening. So then one day he <um> he got so angry about his brother like who like keeps like
**ch_1 : When?**
ch_0 : <um> he actually tried to kill midget. <Yeah> So so midget got really angry about his brother. So he thought about his brother dying while the competition. So he actually almost died
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and went to the hospital.
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : But well he was just he was going to die in a few days. The midget got really <um> I don't know guilty about that and then he just died by himself. So it's some kind of like sad ending. But I guess it was really interesting.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> I like sad endings. I mean I'm someone who likes sad stories or dark stories you know I think I'm a pretty positive person in my daily life but I do like sad and like you know dark and scary stories.
**ch_0 : Okay. <Yeah> Well**
**ch_1 : You too.**
ch_0 : <um> I don't really <um> I don't like them. I won't really read them like I won't really like find those kind of like sad ending stories but if it's there I would read it.
ch_1 : Okay I just feel like if it's always a happy ending, it's kind of boring,
**ch_0 : Okay. <Yeah> Maybe.**
ch_1 : you know you you don't have to agree. <Um> But you know I think there's I like happy stories too, it's not just sad stories that I like, but anyway. Good talk. Let's look at the the article you read risk pooling and health insurance, it's kind of a technical article but not super long. <Um> Did you have any questions while you were reading it
ch_0 : <Um> No, not really. I didn't know the world subsidized.
ch_1 : subsidize? <Yeah> so we especially use this to talk about economic support provided by the government or provided by other people. So clean energy is heavily subsidized by the government and the company subsidizes the education of its longtime employees. So let's just paraphrase these and I can show you what it means. So clean energy is paid for with <um> funding from the government that makes it more affordable for consumers <Um> or this 1 <uh> <um> you know google and Microsoft <um> will pay for the, will pay for their employees to go back to school. <Um> They will give them money for school fees if they agree to continue working there for several years after. So a lot of companies in America do this because education in the USA is so expensive.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : That mike for example my sister, she works in human resources at a company and she's also doing her master's degree, M. B. A. Like a master's in business administration and her company pays for her to take her classes basically, she doesn't have to pay for school because her company pays for her to take her classes
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : as long as she works full time, she can take one or two classes every semester, so it takes a little bit longer for her to do her master's degree than if she were a full time student. But her her fees are subsidized by her company, meaning that as long as she stays at her company for the next few years, she doesn't have to pay that money back, the company pays for it.
**ch_0 : That's great.**
**ch_1 : It's pretty sweet**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : because you know, I mean Her degree probably would cost like $50,000 or something if she paid for it herself.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : But with you know with the help of her company, she doesn't have to worry about that. Pretty pretty awesome.
**ch_0 : That's pretty great.**
ch_1 : <Um> So subsidies basically can work in different ways. It can be like that. There's also like <um> you know for example farmers <uh> get subsidized by the government. So <um> you know some types of farms are going to make a lot of money one year and less money another year, but to make sure that farmers are able to stay,
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : you know operating and don't lose their business. The government will basically give them some money in case the year like their crop is not selling very well, the government will give them some money to subsidize their their business.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : So <yeah> just like those kinds of like when when an organization is paying individuals some extra money that's subsidizing. <Um> And the like especially things like energy companies like gas, oil, clean energy, these are usually subsidized by the government to make them more affordable for consumers. So like
**ch_0 : Where?**
ch_1 : if your parents pay taxes, part of those taxes will go to pay a company that's providing services to the community.
ch_0 : That's great. I guess
ch_1 : <Yeah> it's I guess it's it's it can be
**ch_0 : you're right.**
ch_1 : <um> it could be problematic like
**ch_0 : <Yeah> For**
ch_1 : for example in America the oil and gas companies get a lot of money from the government. And personally I would rather my money didn't go to oil and gas companies but went towards clean energy companies.
**ch_0 : <um> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : That would be my preference. But the government doesn't always do what I want them to do. So I would say that I don't like that they give money to oil and gas companies because those companies are polluting so much, you know, they're they're very bad for the environment
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : and I would like the government to invest more money in things like solar power and wind power. So you know how the money gets used is something that could be up for debate. People could have different opinions on how the money should be used.
ch_0 : <Yeah> Because like every other things like different like which is
ch_1 : <Yeah> everybody's got different opinions and you know, part of the problem is that in the government, there are people who work for oil and gas companies
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : and so those people get to change the laws in ways that are good for their companies and their friends. This is something that I think is kind of a problem, You know, or like weapons companies for example, I would like it to be that you know, we use less weapons that the government should spend less money on weapons, but every year the government spends more money on military weapons and planes and ships and guns and part of that is that there are subsidies coming from the government going towards the weapon companies and there's people in the government who represent the weapons companies and encourage laws that favor them,
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : that kind of thing I think is messed up because I think most people, they want fewer weapons, they want more schools, they want fewer guns and planes and more, you know, cheap food and cheap education and cheap healthcare. But often governments, especially big countries like America or
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : probably also in South Korea, there's a lot of money going towards the military.
ch_0 : Yes there. <Yeah> that's right.
ch_1 : <Yeah> How do you feel about that?
ch_0 : <Um> I guess it's I don't know just maybe I just can't explain.
**ch_1 : Okay,**
**ch_0 : I think**
**ch_1 : take it.**
ch_0 : well that money well kind of has to be used in somewhere. So I guess it's okay I guess.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> I mean I guess it's kind of okay, I think in Korea as well where you have a very militarized country, lots of, you know, everybody's in the military and the military situation is kind of different than most countries.
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> everyone has to go.
ch_1 : <Yeah> maybe that's <uh> maybe that's understandable that the military should be subsidized, but you know like in America like we don't really need the military to be as big as it is, I think in my opinion. <Um> But it seems like it's never shrinking, it's always growing and at the same time that things like school and health care are very expensive. I would love to see some of the money taken from the military and the police and going towards education and health care and like making people have higher pay at their jobs.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : I think that's you know better for society. Let's check out these questions you answered. <Um> Do you think health insurance providers should be allowed to charge cigarette smokers more?
ch_0 : Well yes. I do think that they should charge secret smokers more as they have like a higher risk of getting many kinds of diseases and it might be a reason for at least a few people to quit smoking.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> Do you know any cigarette smokers
ch_0 : My dad I guess.
ch_1 : your dad smokes? <Yeah> my dad too.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : It's a bad habit
**ch_0 : <Yeah> But**
**ch_1 : and**
**ch_0 : well**
**ch_1 : go ahead.**
**ch_0 : no, it's okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> And <uh> does it worry you that your dad smokes?
ch_0 : Well I did worry when I was like in elementary school 3rd or 2nd grade but now I just know that you can't really fix it and you can't really do anything about it.
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : Well I don't really care about.
ch_1 : <Yeah> It's something that people take into their own hands, like, you know, you can tell people like it's bad for your health but they probably will still do it
ch_0 : <Yeah> they don't, they like no
ch_1 : if they like it.
**ch_0 : how much**
ch_1 : <Yeah> they know they know it's bad for them.
ch_0 : not for them. <Yeah>
ch_1 : They must feel that it's bad for them because it's if you smoke you feel it, you know, it's like your lungs don't feel the same to a smoker as it does to you who's not a smoker.
ch_0 : Why why? Why you so right. I I heard that like if you smoke for the first time you don't know why you do this And then about a day or two
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : you suddenly think about smoking and then you try it again.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : It's still bad but you still tried and try it. So I didn't really get that.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <Yeah> It's just addiction, that's how addiction works is in your brain. You have different chemicals called neurotransmitters.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : You've heard of these neurotransmitters.
**ch_0 : No. Not really.**
ch_1 : So these are chemicals such as dopamine chemicals that carry messages and emotions throughout the brain and the body, so such as dopamine serotonin, there's other ones, but those are the two main ones basically dopamine is a chemical in the brain that gives you motivation. It's the thing that when you are feeling happy and you want to do things, your brain is basically producing dopamine. That gives you that feeling
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : much. Like if you drink some coffee you wake up or you don't feel sleepy, dopamine makes you feel motivated, kind of actually similar to coffee.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : Some people who have depression,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : the brain is not producing enough dopamine, so they don't feel a strong sense of motivation and it's harder for them to do things that cause them pleasure
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : when you do things that give you a lot of pleasure and make you feel really happy, feel really good, your brain starts to produce serotonin which is kind of similar to dopamine, but it's the thing, it's the chemical that gives you a long term feeling of happiness and satisfaction.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So basically dopamine gives you the motivation to seek satisfaction and when you're feeling satisfaction long term you get serotonin.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : The problem with addiction is that it directly impacts how your brain uses dopamine. So any kind of pleasurable drug, like alcohol, cigarettes, anything, cocaine, all the different drugs basically make your brain release all of its dopamine all at once. So let's say you have, you know, let's say you have in your brain a cup full of dopamine
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : and every day you're taking a little sip
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : and that's the normal amount of dopamine you're consuming, you're just having a little sip a few times a day and that's your normal rate. But when you take a drug, whether it's a cigarette or alcohol, it's like you're drinking the whole cup and then the next day when you're going for your regular sip of dopamine cups empty, feel bad.
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : And so then you're like, <oh> I feel bad. What I can do is I can smoke another cigarette
**ch_0 : <Oh> okay.**
ch_1 : and it's like suddenly by magic, my cup is almost full. It's not as full as it normally gets, it's almost full. So again, and the problem is that I have to drink it all at once because I'm smoking my cigarette or drinking my drink and it's basically makes my brain use all that dopamine again. So the next day it's even worse, it's even more empty. So I smoke another cigarette and it fills it up again. But this time again, it's not quite full. It's still getting up there, but it's
**ch_0 : And**
ch_1 : it's not as full as it would be if I had never smoked the cigarette. And so each time I'm getting a rush of dopamine, but also when the dopamine wears off, I'm having trouble producing my own.
**ch_0 : <oh>**
ch_1 : And so with something like nicotine, which is the most addictive substance in the world. Once your brain gets locked in that cycle of extra dopamine and no dopamine tied to the smoking of the cigarette, it becomes very difficult to stop because if you stop, you feel terrible, maybe if you stop and quit completely after a few weeks you'll feel great, you'll feel much better.
**ch_0 : okay.**
ch_1 : But in that cycle of addiction, if you stop taking your drug, the result is you feel pain,
ch_0 : <Oh> because you don't have that like dopamine.
ch_1 : you don't have any dopamine so suddenly where you felt normal, you felt motivated, you felt happy now, you feel depressed, you feel angry, you feel like nervous or anxious because the happy chemicals that make you feel good are no longer there or they're just, they're a tiny, tiny little bit. And the other chemicals like you have other things like, you know, hormones like adrenaline or cortisone or cortisol, which basically adrenaline is what you feel when you feel really nervous or anxious or scared. It's what gives you a lot of like energy if you need to fight or run away. Cortisol is the <um> the chemical that releases when you feel stress and normally all of these chemicals should be in a relative balance. You need them sometimes and not others, but you need dopamine all the time.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : If your dopamine and your serotonin fall, it doesn't mean that the other one's fault, those other ones might actually increase. So as one goes down and you feel less and less happy, you might feel more and more anxious or more and more stressed or more and more angry and so, you know, if someone smokes cigarettes and they stop the week after, they might be in a terrible mood.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Like if your dad decided like, okay, I'm going to quit smoking cigarettes, the immediate effect will be like, if things get worse, long term things will get better. Like if you quit cigarettes after a few months,
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : you start to get a lot better, your brain starts producing dopamine. Normally the addiction starts to get lower and lower
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : your lungs start to feel better, you feel better, but in the immediate aftermath of quitting, you feel awful,
ch_0 : So you're like killing your lungs to be happy.
ch_1 : you're killing your lungs to be happy. Exactly, <yeah> <Um> and often people start smoking at such a young age that once you've gotten a tolerance tolerance is when you take a drug over time, it becomes weaker and weaker. So like the first time you smoke a cigarette, I don't I don't smoke cigarettes anymore, but when I was younger I did, and the first time I smoked one, it was so strong that it made me vomit
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : because it was so intense. It's like, it's a, it's a terrible feeling. Never smoke cigarettes, it's the worst. But the first time you smoke it, it's like a big rush. It's a very intense feeling, but after a few, it becomes just normal until once you're fully addicted to cigarettes and you're smoking all the time, the effect of it is totally different. <Um> That's because of tolerance basically, your your body builds up resistance to the chemical, so it takes more of the chemical to give you the same effect. And so <uh> <yeah> killing your lungs to stay happy is a really good way of putting it.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> and there's a lot of things that give us natural boosts of dopamine and serotonin, like exercise for example, <um> spending time with our friends doing art or music or anything that gives you happiness and pleasure gardening. <Um> All of those are going to give you dopamine without drugs, but usually those things require effort and work. So, you know, if you want to do exercise, it takes energy to make yourself do it. If you want to go out in the garden, you have to say, I'm going to go do this. I need to take some steps to go outside and be in the garden. The problem is that if you have no dopamine, you might not feel the motivation to do those things, you might be like, <oh> I'm depressed, I don't have any energy to go running.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : And so it creates a negative cycle where I feel bad. So I have no motivation. So I don't do the thing that gives me motivation, so I have less motivation, so I feel bad. So I don't have motivation. So I don't do you know, it gets worse and worse over time and something like alcohol can get in there and be like, I'm going to make you feel better
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : and maybe it does, but it's slowly hurting your body
**ch_0 : Okay.**
**ch_1 : over time.**
ch_0 : So it's like it's so it's just totally like killing your body to get happy
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : and then it doesn't work slowly.
ch_1 : <Yeah> And maybe it's not necessarily getting happy, but maybe it's, you know, a lot of people who are alcoholics, we have a drinking problem,
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : they might have some kind of pain in their life, maybe physical pain, maybe more likely an emotional pain or a mental pain, like a mental illness or, you know, maybe as Children, they were abused, hurt and the memory of that childhood pain is so bad for them that they drink to forget.
**ch_0 : Okay. Okay.**
ch_1 : So some people, it's maybe not making them happy, it might make them feel just normal, which for them they might perceive as happy, but actually it's just the normal level of functioning and if they take it off, it's like they feel in pain, you know, like a mental pain or a physical pain. So a lot of people with addictions, it's not just that they're trying to be happy as they're trying not to suffer
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : and that's true of almost every addiction, whether it's drugs or drinking or sugar or watching tv all the time, people often do it because it prevents them from feeling bad even if they don't seem very happy on the outside, the absence of that stimuli would they would feel even worse. So, but with cigarettes it's tricky because it's so addictive that once you start, it's very, very hard to stop.
**ch_0 : okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> like, you know, for me, if I smoke a cigarette, I will probably get sick again because I never smoke, but for someone like my grandfather who has smoked every day for the past 60 years for him if he doesn't smoke he probably will feel really anxious and nervous and kind of like agitated.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> Or your you know your dad probably too my dad
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <um> So when they smoke they feel really relaxed. You know people if you've ever seen someone having a smoke break they're like <ah> you know they seem like they're having a good time even though it smells disgusting because their stress level is getting higher and higher and when they smoke the cigarette it brings that stress level down
