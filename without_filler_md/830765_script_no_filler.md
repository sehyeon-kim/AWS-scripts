 : 
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : Hello? <Oh> sorry let me connect my bluetooth.
**ch_0 : hi. No worries.**
**ch_1 : Hi**
**ch_0 : Hi.**
**ch_1 : how are you?**
ch_0 : Good good. I'm in my car.
ch_1 : That's okay. <Um> So I remember you from the lesson we had many weeks or like two months ago I don't even remember but do you remember me?
ch_0 : Right. <Yeah> Actually that's why I just arranged this meeting shortly.
ch_1 : It was very nice to see you again. <Yeah> Wait so okay I just wanna double check since you are in your current <um> do you still can you still see the ringle doc and if I make changes can you still see <um> the questions and stuff?
ch_0 : I not sure all I'm seeing right now is just your face and my my face I don't because this is the first time I used my phone. Is that
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : <yeah> we're about to go to a movie theater. <Yeah> I didn't remember <uh>
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : I just to you know, arrange this meeting <um> when I said yes to my husband, you know. Right.
ch_1 : That's okay. <Yeah> So how how how much time how much time do you have?
ch_0 : <Oh> well <uh> so we're <um> We're starting like in 20 minutes but since I'm already since I'm already in a car,
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <ah> they can move with me.
**ch_1 : Okay. Okay. Okay.**
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Okay <yeah> so <um> do you want To go for the whole 40 minutes or do you want to go for the 20 minutes?
ch_0 : Well we can go for who 40 minutes
ch_1 : Okay. <Yeah> sure. <Um> So I see here that youth,
ch_0 : just like I I think I cannot see, you know the documents at all.
ch_1 : do you want to see if I can try to share my screen and then maybe you can see the typing?
**ch_0 : Sure.**
ch_1 : Okay here let me share screen here. Okay can you see anything?
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Okay perfect. <Yeah> so I see here that you've selected three questions that you wanted to go over <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and you wanted to be a paraphrasing focus to listen so we can definitely do that. I'll just go over the questions with you and we can
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : go over your answers and I'll let you know of any suggestions I have to make your english <um> sound to hear that your goal is to speak more semi formal english or more formal english?
ch_0 : Okay. Right. Right, right.
ch_1 : <Yeah> so we can definitely do that. So here let me just type question warrant. So I see the insight you've chosen is about space economy. <Um> <yeah> so the first question is, what has been the government's role in leading space exploration and research in this past decade?
ch_0 : According to this article, they just, you know, opened the door <ah> to space declaration for people I guess.
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> that's what I <yeah> understood
ch_1 : <Mhm> So was there anything, was there anything specific in the article <um> that you found that was specifically the government's role in leading
**ch_0 : from this article.**
ch_1 : <um> the exploration? Like, is there anything specific that you saw?
ch_0 : <Uh> I I don't remember at all.
**ch_1 : <Oh> that's okay,**
**ch_0 : You see**
**ch_1 : I understand.**
ch_0 : you know what it seems I mean it seems very interesting and I just noticed that more and more articles are about or related to these articles. I mean this space related stuff.
**ch_1 : <Oh> really,**
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> <Uh> <huh> And <uh> since I like sci fi movies <uh> one of sci fi movies I loved was
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : <uh> the title was some dumper.
ch_1 : Downpour, I've never heard of that one actually.
ch_0 : No jumper. <Yeah> jumper. J. U. M. P. E. R. Jumper.
ch_1 : Okay, okay, jumper. Okay, okay.
ch_0 : Have you ever seen that? Or have you ever heard of that?
ch_1 : No, I have not. See I'm <yeah> no.
ch_0 : Okay. Okay. Okay. The protagonist from this movie. <Uh> <ah> kind of got this superpower that he can he could jump wherever he he had ever seen before. So when he <yeah> when he
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
ch_0 : just two wants to go there eagerly
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
**ch_0 : then he's there**
**ch_1 : <mhm> Okay.**
ch_0 : and but he was not like that out of nowhere. I mean just you know one day he just became like that and
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : so and none of his family is not like that. So he he was he's the only superpowered men around
**ch_1 : Okay,**
ch_0 : is the word. And and <um> he had this girlfriend and in that movie the villains <uh> found his power and they tried to use his power do something bad and he
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : he just you know <uh> fight back again
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : <um> and save her his girlfriend and and so on those kind of stuff you know it was a cliche kind of stuff.
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : Anyway <yeah> anyway I really like that movie so I just <uh> but mostly the popular movie had this original novel so I looked into <uh> what was the
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : original Novel for that movie and found one
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and I read it and interestingly the writer wrote the sequel for that novel and the second
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
ch_0 : <yeah> the second sequel he his girlfriend
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : kind of robbed is that very roll off his superpower. Is there is the right road down what
**ch_1 : <Oh> wow. <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : well hey?**
**ch_1 : it's <hmm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> she she also gained <oh> his super power so they became <yeah> they became
**ch_1 : <Oh> wow,**
ch_0 : the super power couple and a third And in 3rd sequel is there a novel? <Ah> They had their two child kid girl
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : and she was born like that
**ch_1 : There were three,**
ch_0 : <Yeah> 3 3 novels. And you know what that in the last novel? That car she <oh> she she eagerly she pondered and I think she
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : she thinks hard about her ability
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and she found or she here theoretically she set up a theory
**ch_1 : She theorize is**
ch_0 : that <yeah> a few rises
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : that she might move, she might not just jump from one spot two two other
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : but but also she moved very fast. Are By dumping just one step by one step you know what I mean?
**ch_1 : <Uh> <huh>**
ch_0 : So she <yeah> she so she moves she moves the spot very near very close spot. <Ah> She moves to she moves to <uh> from spot to spot very quickly
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : then she could she could run or move very fast just like the flash.
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> So <yeah> <yeah> so so she she made it and she she just she just go to the space
ch_1 : <Oh> wow, that is a crazy plan.
ch_0 : <uh> in the end in the end of the story, what she did was collecting the space garbage. E
**ch_1 : <Oh> wow,**
ch_0 : I know the novel is so fun and interesting. I was like a page turner for me and
ch_1 : okay. No, that's good. It's good that at least it's really engaging and really exciting and really, it's like a good hook, <yeah>
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> <yeah> <yeah> like <uh> <huh> was it <Yeah> that novel, I'm not sure when I read it it's like seven or 8 years old <uh> a few years <uh> before I came to Winnipeg. But whenever I
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : these days whenever I see this kind of article and when I saw a clip,
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : you know <uh> included this section,
ch_1 : <Yeah> <yeah> in the, <yeah> the video,
ch_0 : I was talking about the the future space garbage in the future in the near future. The 2nd 1. The space border.
ch_1 : <oh> the space border that could seal us on Earth, Yes.
ch_0 : <Yeah> <yeah> it's mentioning About the garbage because right now 6000 satellites are already
**ch_1 : <Oh> wow.**
ch_0 : and <yeah> and half of them are broken.
**ch_1 : <Oh> wow,**
**ch_0 : <Yeah> And 11**
ch_1 : I didn't know that,
ch_0 : <yeah> it's a says that 11 satellites were shooting see her In 2022
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : and that number is very beaten number compared to you know, the the numbers in the past
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : over, you know, many years.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So basically saying that the number companies are shooting the satellites into space is increasing, you know, exponentially and at some point, but <uh> most of them would you know, <ah> stop working and just float in the space and at some point
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <ah> because of that RBG floating around orbit <uh> it might be hard for companies to shoot more <uh> new new satellite
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : because they there is the possibility that they might, you know, bump into that broken floating garbage junk. I mean the space junk.
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <yeah>**
ch_1 : okay, that is really interesting actually,
ch_0 : <yeah> So, so when I all these, I just kept no thinking of that novel written,
**ch_1 : <yeah>**
ch_0 : written like a decade ago.
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> really interesting. It's a really weird, you know,
ch_1 : that is really interesting. That's a really cool connection
ch_0 : you <yeah> it feels really weird. <Mhm>
ch_1 : though between the novel that you thought was really like out like extraordinary, like really crazy and then this
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> article on these like video clips that are talking about something that's happening now. <Yeah>
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm> These days I feel more and more, you know, the imagination, which I thought that it would be never no being realized, I mean in real life
ch_1 : <Mhm> <mm> <hmm> <Yeah> <yeah> <yeah> for sure.
ch_0 : it's getting <mhm> realize there right.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <yeah> <yeah> <yeah> it's getting realized, <yeah>
ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> it's kind of hard to finish the sentence.
ch_1 : no, it's okay, that's okay. <Um> <yeah> I mean then moving on to I guess maybe the second question which is a little bit more about like the business is leading the development,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : so will private businesses lead the development for a space for space sector, why or why not?
ch_0 : Well, according to this article is already leading the space sector.
**ch_1 : Okay,**
ch_0 : <Yeah> and and we know <uh> the Face Acts and the other company name,
**ch_1 : <uh>**
ch_0 : <Oh> I don't remember anyway, there are two more companies
**ch_1 : Space explorer origin?**
ch_0 : and <yeah> blue and region
ch_1 : <Mhm> And Virgin galactic.
ch_0 : and and we're <yeah> <yeah> <Uh> <huh>
**ch_1 : Yes.**
ch_0 : <Yeah> they are sending people word to the space or to learn.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Uh> <huh> So <yeah>
ch_1 : And how do you like as a follow up question, how do you feel about that? Do you think that it's like a good thing? It's a good advancement and for technology or do you think it's like too crazy. Too much space exploration is too much?
ch_0 : <yeah> <Uh> well think everything happened, no matter, no matter how people wanted to, no, I mean no bigger everything happens. Well, it's supposed to happen,
ch_1 : Okay, <yeah> Yes, yes.
ch_0 : that's what I think. <Ah> so of course there are a lot of people who don't like that idea because there are a lot of poor people, there are a lot of you know, problems we have faced at in this real word.
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So I know a lot of people our thinking think that kind of a waste of money
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : <ah> but you that kind of challenge has been done for over, I don't know, 100 years.
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> so doesn't matter if I like it or not, I think it will, it will go on just like that and and <um> through there kind of development or through that challenge can achieve lot, we buy products I guess.
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> so like for example, the titanium <uh> <uh> titanium has a very high melting point compared to gold or silver.
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : So it was hard to manipulate in the past
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : but carol pero business error company, a real business.
ch_1 : <Yeah> the aerospace companies.
ch_0 : <Yeah> Aerospace companies, sorry, using that material and now lot of medical stuff is made of, especially in implants, artificial influence is made of that.
**ch_1 : Okay, okay.**
ch_0 : <Yeah> So when people are investing and spending a lot of time and money into some high end technology, the end goal not so final goal you achieve I guess a lot of byproducts from that process.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : The real fruits we have. That's what I think.
**ch_1 : <mm> <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : No, that's really, really, I think that's super cool like <um> I guess connection you made between like what you pick your personal opinions about space exploration and like aerospace companies and it's something that is also related to I guess the real world and like the world, you know and the world you have learned about. I didn't even know that titanium was used in a lot of like artificial implants and stuff now, even though before it was like really difficult
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : to learn how to manipulate. So I think that's super cool and I think that is a very good answer, <Yeah>
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Uh> <huh> It happens a lot. <Ah> So the thing is that in my opinion the word was never equal or Egalitarian terrians between people or or <mm> the well or power was never distributed between no worse. <Mhm> My making.
ch_1 : Between sorry, between what? Between worlds? <Yeah> no that's true.
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> Between countries.
ch_1 : Do you think it's more now or no?
ch_0 : Never no, never. So there there has been always strong countries and re countries
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : a strong man and weak man and there's always
**ch_1 : Right. Right.**
ch_0 : <yeah> there has always been rich, there there have been always been rich people and poor people
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : never being like a the word everybody is equal.
**ch_1 : Right. <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> the the the word, you know the the ideal word or final goal word for like communist communist ideology. There never
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : word has word has never been like that.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So <yeah> so rich people, if they have, you know enough money to invest to this space business,
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : they should do that.
ch_1 : <Yeah> that's interesting. Do you think you would invest in those companies yourself or do you think it's like something you just want to stay out of and watch from afar?
ch_0 : I'm not that rich, I'm not that rich but I don't mind. They you know spend their money too that space.
ch_1 : <Yeah> I mean I guess no you probably think that they're better,
**ch_0 : Right.**
ch_1 : better things to spend it on.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> no that's cool. That's definitely very valid and you know it's like
ch_0 : No I'm I'm probably <mhm>
ch_1 : a business, I feel like we literally don't know anything about so. <Oh> hello?
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : Cool. Hello? Who? Hello?
ch_0 : Hi. <Yeah> let's just switch it from that wifi to L. T. I guess.
ch_1 : <Oh> okay, okay. <Yeah> <yeah> no that's that's okay, that's okay.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : <Um>**
ch_0 : Okay. You know what would you just you know <um> paraphrase <uh> the words I just spoke to you For 20 minutes and let's call it a date. I mean the scoring nine let's let's finish it here. <Yeah> <Yeah>
ch_1 : Yes, <yeah> actually no problem, no problem of course. <Um> <Yeah> so
ch_0 : <Yeah> Okay thank you so much.
**ch_1 : it's**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <um> <yeah> no, so for I mean your first answer, it was very short and simple, so honestly I don't have very much to say, but I think your second answer was really interesting. <Um> So looking at your first answer to the main question you said according to this article,
**ch_0 : Okay. <Mhm>**
ch_1 : it's already opening the space sector. <Um> However I think
**ch_0 : No**
ch_1 : one thing would for you to consider it would be too I guess pinpointing what this like it's like what do you mean by it's already leading the space sector, what is already leading the space sector? I think
**ch_0 : Okay**
ch_1 : just because it's like your first sentence <um> you want whoever you're talking to to know exactly like
**ch_0 : just you know**
ch_1 : what <um> piece of information you were trying to get with them. So here I would I would just correct it and like put
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : in the in the comment, like identify exactly what? Okay. <Yeah> So here in your original <um> like intention, what was what did you intend to say? Like according to the article, what did you mean? Like, what is already leading the space sector? Like the private businesses?
ch_0 : <Oh> I okay would you say it again?
ch_1 : <Yeah> So <um> if you had to say the sentence again <um> according to your
ch_0 : I'm according to this article
ch_1 : <Yeah> So according to your original intention, what <um> were you trying to say? <Um> what were you trying to say is already leading the space sector? Is it the the private businesses or is it like the government?
ch_0 : <yeah> the pro business is the pro business <yeah>
ch_1 : Okay. Okay. Okay. So I'll put this here here and then this second sentence is fine and we know here instead of the ambulance, we know that space explore origin and virgin galactic are already sending people to the space or to the moon. <Um> Here. <Uh> My only thing is you would you don't need to write the when you're speaking about space and the it's like really small and it's honestly very random. <Um> It's like it's just something very
ch_0 : Okay got it gotcha.
ch_1 : small, but it's something that it's more common to say
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : you I'm going to space or I'm going to actually sorry, you would say I'm going to the moon, I think because <um> the moon is like one singular. So you have to use this predetermine er of the
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : to say I'm going to the one thing moon, but since space is not one thing, it's like a vast
**ch_0 : Got it. <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Thing <um> you just say I'm going to six. <Yeah> <Um> and then second
ch_0 : Thank you. Almost every day
ch_1 : looking at your answer to the following question
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <um> this is fine. Everything happens when it's supposed to happen. So of course there are a lot of people who don't like that idea
**ch_0 : But**
ch_1 : and there are a lot of people <uh> okay here actually here I would suggest putting this up into two sentences. So of course there are a lot of people who don't have that idea. And then for your second sentence you can go about your second idea which is there are a lot of poor people
**ch_0 : <yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and then comma there are a lot of other problems we face in the real world. So since this is just two ideas, I would just suggest splitting the ideas up into two separate sentences <um> Just so you avoid the run on sentence. But <yeah> otherwise that's fine.
ch_0 : <Mhm> It wasn't and here we go. Okay.
ch_1 : <Um> Here we can take out the cell. I know a lot of people who think that it's kind of a waste of money, waste of money.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : But still that kind of challenge has been done over 100 years. So here when you say that kind of challenge has been done over 100 years, do you mean? <Um> the challenge of space exploration has been investigated or researched or worked on for over 100 years? Okay,
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> <Yeah> <Yeah> almost or over your
ch_1 : no that's fine. <Um> <Yeah> I would just suggest using like a different vocabulary instead of
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : that kind of challenge has been done because the were done is not very precise in understanding what you mean. So here I would just say
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : that kind of talent has been worked on
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : or hasn't worked on or researched for over 100 years. So this vocabulary just makes it more precise, it just makes <um> your your point more precise. <Um> So does that make sense so far?
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Okay. <Uh> and then moving on, so it doesn't matter if I like it or not, it will go on just like that, that is fine.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> Okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> through that kind of development or through so here I would say we can just shorten this <um> up into like a simpler sentence. So here I would suggest just saying through these kinds of
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : developments and challenges, people can achieve a lot
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : actually, we can say people can't advance lot from such buy products. So here, instead of saying through that kind of development or through that challenge, we can just shorten it and say through these kinds of developments and challenges and then instead of saying people can achieve a lot, we can just say people can advance a lot from by products because achieving means there is a goal that you have completed but your point is that we can keep growing and advancing our technology as a society and like keep getting better. So instead, advance would be a more appropriate word because achieved means like there's one goal and you're achieving it. But here it's more like <um> a consistent growth
**ch_0 : Right. Right.**
ch_1 : and a consistent improvement. So that's why I chose to use advance instead of achieve that. Does that make sense?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> <Yeah> totally.
ch_1 : <Um> And then here, honestly, this next example, again, as I said before, I think it's super cool. So for example, like the titanium <um> here, titanium can also just be without the predetermine er of the so for example, like titanium, this is because you're not speaking like one piece of titanium, you're speaking of titanium like as a whole, so you don't need that, you don't need the
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : so for example, like titanium, titanium has a very high melting point compared to gold or silver, so it's hard to manipulate in the past. That's good. Aerospace companies started using that material and now a lot of medical stuff. Okay, here, I would just also quickly suggest medical stuff can be <um> the word stuff is again just more general and vague,
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Oh>**
ch_1 : so instead we can say a medical equipment,
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : especially artificial implants are made of titanium <um> <yep> And then here, so when people are investing and spending a lot of time and money into some high end technology. <Um> here I would also suggest taking out some <um> it's not like really dramatic to do with the grammar, it's just more fluency. Taking some of these filler words like some or so just kind of helps declutter your sentences <um> and again just makes them more concise. <Um> So here I took out some and then used to say and the high end technology, the end goal is not the final goal. We achieve. A lot of byproducts from that process are the real fruits we have. I think this is a really good ending sentence. My one suggestion would be here in this little sentence before the end goal is not the final goal we achieve. It's like a little bit vague <um> what you mean by that just because you say end goal and final goal and those two things are kind of similar.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So <um> instead of saying the end goal is not the final goal we achieved. I was suggesting like
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> the final go we reach is not always the original goal
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : we planned on we planned for. So here you're kind of saying like the final goal we reach is not always the original goal. We planned for a lot of byproducts from that process are the real fruits. So this kind of shows the comparison that the final goal is different from the original goal. Instead of saying like the end goal and the final goal because it's just because end and
**ch_0 : Sure**
ch_1 : final are kind of synonyms. So it becomes a little bit confusing <um> when you use them side by side and you're trying to talk about two different things. So does so does that make sense?
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> Sounds perfect
ch_1 : <Yeah> So <um> that's basically it. I think you have a very well structured and well phrased sentence. It's just some little things to help with precision and accuracy of vocabulary. <Um> <Yeah> <Um> do you have any more questions for me or do you want to just end here?
ch_0 : <yeah> <Yeah> let's end it here
ch_1 : Okay. I'll stop the screen sharing. <Yeah> No.
ch_0 : thank you. Okay again.
ch_1 : Yes. Bye. Have a great rest of your day.
ch_0 : <Yeah> Do why? Thank you
