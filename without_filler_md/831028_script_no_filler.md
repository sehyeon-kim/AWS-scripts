ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm> Okay, I entirely understand. All right. So are you seeking to just so that I understand <um> I see that you would like to make your english sound more formal. <Ah> Is that correct? Are you leaning towards more formal as opposed to casual english because of the
ch_0 : no I am leaning towards more former english because of yes S. A. S. A. T. And tougher tests as well.
ch_1 : Okay, got it. Okay, perfect. Alright, so because of that <um> we can definitely work on that. I will offer suggestions based off of that feedback. <Uh> especially since we're working or verbal english. Are there any topics you'd like to begin with? <Um>
ch_0 : So I want to I want you to like kind of kind of like lead me on to some questions like you can ask me whatever you want and because I I don't know what to say really.
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : You don't believe it was like <oh> my gosh what can I say to her? I don't I don't know anything about her. So
**ch_1 : Okay.**
**ch_0 : no offense.**
ch_1 : That's okay. No worries. I can definitely bring up some Tofel sample questions and start asking and see if <um> see if I can we can work off that. <Uh> Let's see, let me just pull them up so that we can have some too <uh> there we go to. Okay. Actually others asked generally. How was your weekend?
**ch_0 : So my weekends**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : well what did I do? <Yeah> I went to prison. Do you know what where is where a person is the southeast of Korea that is located very south
**ch_1 : Yes.**
**ch_0 : and**
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : I went there with my mother because <um> we didn't plan on going to prison but I just wanted to go to go there because I don't know I didn't have any reasons. I just want to escape from my element that they
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : so we so like foggy foggy Seanie Senior Sinner. No sinner since
ch_1 : With <uh> foggy scenery?
**ch_0 : scenery. Yes, scenery.**
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : And we so we also so auction as well of course there there is a well known for auction like dot coms. So and we ate some kind of fish fish
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : cuisine in Korea.**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : And that's or I can like remember for now as of now I was like they're texting my to my friends
**ch_1 : That's it.**
ch_0 : so I couldn't really focus on traveling with my mother the time.
ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm> <mm> I see. <Um> what was your favorite part of the trip?
ch_0 : So I took a train like it's not train train it was a small train that is that goes up to the mountain
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : and goes back to the bottom of the place. So I took the train and we we like went through or the places that order spots that has given to <um> visitors.
ch_1 : <Mm> I see it. Okay. <Uh> and then <uh> what did your mother enjoy most about the trip
ch_0 : My mother I didn't really ask her, ask her what did she what what what is the most part you really enjoyed?
**ch_1 : you think?**
ch_0 : But I think my mother enjoyed like right writing writing on the cable curve.
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : It goes to the other other side of the mountain and goes back to the one it goes 11 way and it goes back the other round like that.
ch_1 : Okay that's great. Alright. Based off of that, would you like to <uh> are you alright with correcting your responses?
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : Perfect. Okay let me just go ahead and again. I'm just gonna go ahead and write down the questions I asked as well. Can you see the Ringo taco? Right,
**ch_0 : All right.**
ch_1 : that's part of, can you see the Ringel documents that I'm typing on? Okay.
ch_0 : <Yeah> I I can see that now.
ch_1 : Okay, perfect. Okay, so you said <uh> for my weekend, well could have a party. Well I went to in the southeast of Korea, that is located very north. I went there with my mother because I'm going? I'm going to
ch_0 : Right. <Huh> So you you were supposed to say like very nurse but instead of nurse you said nurse instead of south. So I corrected you.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <Oh> <Oh> I see. Very I see North. Very north.
ch_0 : No it's located very self you just nurse. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Oh> <uh> as then, <Oh> where do you mean here or
ch_0 : I mean I mean you when you read when you were reading
**ch_1 : first?**
ch_0 : so the sentences. Exactly.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Oh> did I say north.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Oh> I see I meant very south. I went there with my mother because we didn't plan on going to Tucson but I I just wanted to go there. I don't know I didn't have any reason. I just wanted to escape from my element that day. We saw foggy scenery and we also saw ocean as well. There's a well known ocean there and we ate some kind of fish cuisine in Korea and that's all that I can remember for now this all sounds fairly good. The only part that sounds dramatically strange was we saw foggy scenery. <Um> Instead what you would want to say is the theory was very foggy.
ch_0 : Yes it was I was trying to say to you
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but my message wasn't really clear clear enough to understand for a native a native speaker.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <Mhm> <Yeah> But this is very this is still the the prime messages still communicated which is great. <Uh> This is more just very this is a very small grammatical <um> It's just a small grammatical mistake that makes it sound a bit natural but it's definitely still understandable. 100%. <Um> You said there's a lot of the notion there and we had some kind of korean that's all I remember for now. <Uh> So everything else looks good. Everything. Although is very casual. <Uh> You can say for example instead of went you can say visited. These are just <um> actually I will add them as paraphrasing because these are suggestions. It's not that these are wrong.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : These are just suggestions to make your english sound more formal visited. Well I visited <um> Tana the post to win too. Let's see I will just I'll cross it out just so that it's not as the paragraph long so well I visited. Wasn't is you can even say is located is located in the southeast of Korea? <Oh> no you're located already. Actually. That one's fine is in south Korea. That is located very south. I went there with my mother because we don't want to go into the song but I just wanted to go there. <Um> Everything else looks good, there's a one on ocean, there were some kind of fish cuisine <uh> <um> you can say a paraphrasing care that may sound more formal is we dined We got into there and <um> eight <um>
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : A I <Yeah> type of fish cuisine.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> native to Korea. Example if the fish cuisine is specific to Korea. <Um> I don't know if this is true, so that's correct in what you.
**ch_0 : That's correct.**
ch_1 : Okay perfect. So this is a more formal way of expressing this. We dined there in a a type of fish cuisine native to Korea.
ch_0 : The thing is I really don't know what is former vocabulary and I don't know between former vocabulary and informer vocabulary and I say something. I don't know if it's former or for former way to say or it is an informal way to say
**ch_1 : <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : like I knew the words died nine but I didn't know it was a former board.
ch_1 : <Mhm> Yes. So typically I think what you'll hear, I think the distinguish mint comes from or the difference comes from what is commonly used in casual english and what is typically seen in literature. So more formal english takes vocabulary from literature. You will see dining
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Uh> <huh>**
ch_1 : in books more than you will see it in spoken english
ch_0 : Right. I think so. I show those kind of words that you flexed my
**ch_1 : me.**
ch_0 : some, some sentences there on my own. Some researchers. Yes, that's true.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> absolutely because this is the your english is very good and it is <uh> the only difference is that it is very casual and I'm just really picking very small things out to potentially aid or formative in formalizing it. <Uh> Right. Do you have any questions any other questions about any of the corrections I made here.
**ch_0 : No,**
ch_1 : Got it. Alright so you said I took a train. It's not a train train. It was a small train that goes up to the mountain and goes down to the bottom of the place.
ch_0 : I have a question necessary to interview.
**ch_1 : <Ah> If.**
ch_0 : What is that? What is the court train? But that is like
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : not a typical train just goes to another like reason. It is a train that goes to mountain for to take for visitors to take in to write an into
ch_1 : I see I think is the original trainer referring to a subway train and the other one a railroad train because
**ch_0 : the train.**
ch_1 : <yeah> I think that's what you what you mean right. Railroad versus a subway train.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : Subway is a subterranean. So below the ground and this is a sort of a
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : above the ground and your, you can see outside
ch_0 : <mm> Yes. Railroad railroad train
**ch_1 : I see.**
ch_0 : what? I I can't really, I can't really like pronounce that word. Railroad. Railroad train, it's okay.
ch_1 : <Mhm> Yes that's that's good. Yes it's always the second softer. That's a bit of an issue. But railroad is correct.
**ch_0 : Railroad. Alright**
ch_1 : <Mhm> If let me just also make sure that that is <Yeah> the correct way of <um> Rail transport. <Yeah> Railroad train
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <uh> railroads just referred to trains. Okay. I think it's fine to say railroad train. I was just making sure it doesn't sound awkward but. Alright so so here maybe what you say is it's not a subway train. <Um> It was the small railroad train instead.
**ch_0 : Yes,**
ch_1 : Railroad train that goes up to the mountain and goes down to the very bottom of the place. <Um> Perfect. Maybe here you might want to specify, do you mean places in Bhutan or do you mean the destination or?
**ch_0 : I mean like**
**ch_1 : <Uh> <huh>**
ch_0 : but <um> I said the train went to, went up on the top of the mountain and went back to the bottom of the like some kind of that is alright <yeah>
ch_1 : At the base of the mountain? I see you can just say at the bottom of it actually you can
ch_0 : or just it was a hill, not like a mountain, it was like smart steve <um> like it can be seen as a mountain but it's more like I think it's a hill.
ch_1 : okay in which case you can likely say <uh> it goes up up to the hill
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and goes down to the bottom of of it. You can either say it or you can repeat hill. Typically use it to replace the literal announce. You can say it to the bottom of it because we have the context of the hill and going up and going back down
**ch_0 : Wasn't**
ch_1 : everything looks good. <Uh> And then ask the question that I did not ask my mother what was the most part she enjoyed? I think my mother and dad reading the cable car that goes to the other side of the mountain, this was great. <Ah> Here what will you one would say is I did not ask my mother what part she enjoyed most.
**ch_0 : <mhm>**
ch_1 : So here is that it would be, I did not ask my mother what part she enjoyed the most. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : because as you can see enjoy most is enjoy its first, right? And then most of there is an emphasis so that's why you would
**ch_0 : right.**
**ch_1 : we <uh>**
ch_0 : I really don't know if I said like I did not ask my mother what the most party that she enjoyed or what was the most part she has enjoyed or I don't know, I think I said I what the most part that she has enjoyed.
ch_1 : the most part that she has enjoyed.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : I see it's still has enjoyed. It's still a bit <uh> it sounds that sounds just a little bit unnatural
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : in <uh> for for a native speaker typically will rephrase the question the same way that someone has asked it. So that's why you would say I did not ask my mother what part she enjoyed most because that's what did your mother enjoy most?
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So that's here. You can use this to to phrase your response my mother enjoyed most, right, as opposed to the most part that she had enjoyed.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> or you would if you wanted to sound correct you would actually maybe just say I did not ask my mother what was the part that she had enjoyed,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : but most would be left at the end still. <Um> This is this sounds slightly more natural without the most here, but it still sounds
**ch_0 : Right.**
ch_1 : slightly <um> off in some way.
**ch_0 : Yes upwards.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> It sounds a bit awkward, which is why I would recommend just <um> echoing the question back right in your response,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Does that make sense? Or do you or do you have any other questions or concerns?
ch_0 : No it definitely does.
ch_1 : Okay, perfect. Alright, so just continuing onwards, <uh> let's see, what else can I ask? <Um> Let me see if I can still pull up the questions <um> I think these would be great. <Oh> here we go. Okay. <Um> describe any one of the best moments of your life. This isn't quite a question but outside on the document?
ch_0 : <Mhm> So if I can time trouble I will go back to my of the lessons <um> because I have so much regrets in my other other lessons. I want to like change the topic a little bit because I I want to talk about like my regrets more than what
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : what when I my life was really good.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So first firstly to answer your question I enjoyed my life the most is when I was five years old I bought I saw my first dog I vote her
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and we we are like we it was really nice to to pick her up and bring brought him brought her into my into the into my home and <yeah> she was honorable but we lost her like when I was 10 that is the satisfy satisfy parts
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and on both. I have my I have a lot of regrets in my life. If I can go back to my adolescence it'll be like I can change my things that that is a result of of my time gone by. For example when I was a middle school student I was going to go to the United States once I had the chance but I
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : just blown it away blew it away so I I really have this vast unbearable regret in my life.
ch_1 : <Mhm> This vast regrettable regret.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : It's gonna look great if I see it. <Oh> <um> girl based on that <uh> what
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : was the moat? Okay, so what was what <um> what was what exactly about <um> missing this opportunity? Like missing, missing this opportunity <um> affected you most.
ch_0 : So if I went there in my
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : middle school years, look at a like green card because I couldn't like
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : adopted. I could be adopted to my distance relatives who live in the United States. But I am over aged so I can't get a green card now. And I really admire
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : people in the United States because of the cultural diversity, cultural culture of diversity. Yes.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : Okay.**
**ch_1 : World diversity. Great.**
ch_0 : But I am not really afraid that if I go to <uh> I'm planning on going to the United States when my, during my mother's winter break. But I am afraid that if I can if what if I can, I will encounter like any kind of racism in the United States now it's like increasing crazily I can see that on some kind of videos on Youtube. So I have this like worries that take me back from going there.
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : It takes me back from going there.
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : And I think <um> yes, that's or my or I have to answer
ch_1 : <Mhm> Perfect. I see. Great. <Uh> Alright, so we can definitely start reviewing <um> Alright, so you said when I asked.
ch_0 : reviewing after, after we finished <uh> you're like
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
ch_0 : five or Our like seven minutes before we finished, could you do the reviewing
**ch_1 : <yeah> absolutely.**
**ch_0 : according?**
ch_1 : <Yeah> of course. So do you mean for example, This is until 10:40? So just for me to start reviewing at 10:33 for the full summary?
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : Okay, perfect. Alright, I will definitely do that. Okay, so looking at these responses, <uh> if I can time travel to go back to my adolescence, I have so much regrets in my adolescence. Only one minor thing I would say I have so many many versus much. Instead I have so many regrets in my adolescent.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Uh> the message still comes through. It's just that much is used for quantity I think. How would I describe this?
ch_0 : Emoji used for uncountable words right?
ch_1 : Because <Yeah> And many is used for, you can say one regret. 2345. It's worth very exact numbers or numbers that are accountable. So I have so many regrets in my adolescence firstly to answer your question. I enjoyed my life when I was five years old. I saw my first dog, I bought her and it was really nice to pick her up and brought her into my home. She was adorable, but we lost her when I was 10. That is the saddest part. I have a lot of regrets in my life. For example, when I was a middle school student, I had a chance to go to the United States, but I blew it away. <Oh> here, just I don't know if you said blue or blown but it is definitely blew it away as a pastor.
ch_0 : Yes, firstly I said blowing it away, but I knew I was like made a mistake. So I like fixed my
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : sentence of sentence sentence. So I had
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : I blew it away again after I've blown it Okay, blowing away.
ch_1 : <Yeah> Perfect. Alright. Great. Great self correction. That's amazing. So then <uh> but I blew it away. I have this past regrettable regret in my life. <Uh> Everything looks good. <Uh>
ch_0 : Are there like any grammatical grammatical slips? See?
ch_1 : <uh> Not necessarily, you don't seem to have any grammatical slips. There is
**ch_0 : No. <Yeah>**
ch_1 : here you <uh> dwindle between past and present a little bit. Well it's It still works here because that I bought and it was and brought so you keep everything in past 10. <Um> And these ends, I mean it's expected to
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : to have this happen for example. I mean like the
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : the correct grammatical way of saying this would probably be taking a pause here instead of saying. And
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I brought, I brought her, it was really nice to pick her up and brought her into my home. <Um> Or you would say I brought her and realized it was really nice to pick her up and brought her into my home. But it still seems to or I mean this would make it sound a bit clear and realized it was really nice to pick her up and brought her into my home,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : right? Because then it sort of leads into chronological order as to what you brought her home,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : but that's the only suggestion I have grammatically outside of that. Everything makes sense. Regrettable regret is a bit repetitive, but it can be used this way. So that's why I don't think it's a grammatical error
ch_0 : I feel I said unbearable
**ch_1 : unbearable. I see**
ch_0 : sorry my pronunciation was incorrect.
ch_1 : it's okay. I had I had I think fallen behind at this point as well a little bit, and so I had to <um> I think I kind of guessed I only heard a bowl, and so that's okay, so unbearable regret in my life. So everything looks good.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So any suggestions that I provide would just be to formalize your english, but I will say this is great <um> transitional phrases are always amazing. So, firstly to answer your question. <Um> that's great, for example, when I was a middle school student here was a chance to use because you started with firstly, you could have said here, as well as just to provide secondly as well here, for example is still good, but because firstly, you can also say, secondly thirdly, for <um> a lot of depressed in my life <um> here the sentences sounds a bit unnatural. <Um> This is the saddest part. <Um> you might want to provide a context. This is the status part of my childhood flash <um> young, like adolescent essence. Right? So,
**ch_0 : Maybe**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : it will be the saddest part of my her life entire life because I can never be like I will never be able to be that regrettable in my in my entire life. I am.
ch_1 : <Uh> so it is actually so it isn't the saddest part of my entire life, what you're saying.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> Yes. <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I see that's perfect. This is the context that you sort of need of my entire life. That makes it sound a lot more natural. That's perfect. Right? And you just said I have a lot of regrets in my life and then you said you provided the next example which is great <um> great use of vocabulary, vast unbearable, perfect. They said if I went to <uh> ask you about what about this opportunity affected you most. <Uh> if I went there in my middle school years I could have adopted been adopted to my distant relatives who live in the United States. I really admire people in the States because of the cultural diversity. I am planning to ongoing <uh> to <oh> this is my mistake. Could be us or States during my mother is not great but I'm afraid what if I encounter some kind of races in the United States? It isn't increasing increasingly. I have this worries.
**ch_0 : Crazy! Crazily.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> Crazily I see I was gonna say I think I think this was another one where I misheard okay increasing crazily I have this worries that takes me <uh>
**ch_0 : <Mm> <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : it takes me back from going there. So this is all good. I know you mentioned something about having being able to obtain a green card there. So let me <um> adopted hereby instead by welcome back color. I could have been adopted by my relatives who live in the United States. I really admire people in United States because of the <um> of their cultural diverse. I think you said they're here. And I think I might have just built it incorrectly. So their cultural diversity. I'm planning on going to the United States during my mother's winter break. So here's a way to fix this and make this sound more formal that all purpose <um> on going to the U. S. During my mother's winter break. But I am here let's attend this here. However, I am afraid of encountering <um> some kind of so the phrasing kind of is a bit informal kind of <um>
**ch_0 : Some sort of**
ch_1 : It's so we have some sort of is a little bit more <um> so more formal way is as you said sort of for <um> type of.
**ch_0 : <mhm> Type.**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : No. Right**
ch_1 : <Yeah> So I've been countering some sort of racism in the United States. <Um> It is increasing crazy lee which works here because you had already you just said but here right. But I am afraid of what if I encounter some kind of race in the United States? I think I think it would be great too use the more formal way of but more formal work which is however.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Mhm> Do you have any questions about this correction?
ch_0 : No no I don't have any questions about your corrections but I have one question about like other side or the side of your like a set of your corrections
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : <uh> is <um>**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : well there is there is <um> there are in former like impolite language use and polite language used. How can you like do polite language use instead of like being roomed towards others.
**ch_1 : <Ah>**
ch_0 : I mean for example I go to a restaurant for example I need to say thank you like please please. But it is really awkward to say please at the end of the sentence when we order other things in korean.
ch_1 : I see. So typically it does it might sound strange in korean but typically that is the way that it pleases views
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : in english. So let's say I'm ordering a drink right? You can say I want I'd like a coffee. Thank you. Or you'd say I'd like a coffee please. I think you can also replace pleased with thank you
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : if you get a response
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : pleased that the end is not entirely necessary. <Um>
ch_0 : necessary like to say please at the end of the order?
ch_1 : <Mhm> So let's say, could I get a latte and someone said of course, how you know the waiter or the cashier responds with? <Yeah> Would would that be a large and say yes, thank you. So.
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
**ch_1 : Right.**
ch_0 : what if I don't I don't say please at the end. How could you like
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : think if I didn't say please to you when you're a cashier or something, what would you think of that kind of attitude?
**ch_1 : It's not**
**ch_0 : Native native speaker**
ch_1 : <uh> it wouldn't be <uh> super rude. It wouldn't be something that is very rude, or even some people may not even consider it rude. The reason is because at least in the United States we do not treat our customer service employees very well. So <um>
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : it may just be seen as <uh> maybe that you've had a bad day or maybe you're just not <um> very involved in the interaction.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Um> But it's not necessarily very rude. For example, I think <um> in other cultures, customer service employees are treated better, but in the United States they are not treated very well. <Uh> So
ch_0 : Really? That's <yeah> because in Korea we treat our customers really with our
**ch_1 : <yeah>**
ch_0 : or heartful execute like be here
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : with a customer. Yes it is really.
ch_1 : And then and then that's reflected back, Right? It's so
ch_0 : <Yeah> Well sorry to here in the United States. They don't treat their customers really well.
ch_1 : <yeah> or it's it's more so the other way around. So I think <uh> So how do I explain this? It's sort of the other way it is and customers do not treat the workers well.
**ch_0 : Really?**
ch_1 : So so that's common. Yes. So I think especially in other like asian countries, South Korea. <Yeah> So in other asian countries such as South Korea or Japan <um> the employees treat customers very well and in response to customers treat employees very well.
ch_0 : This is their <mhm> <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Um> Right, so it's it's equal
**ch_0 : whatever.**
ch_1 : in the United States <uh> employees treat customers okay or very well and then customers do not treat employees
**ch_0 : Okay. <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : very well. So**
**ch_0 : You know cat,**
ch_1 : so if you if
ch_0 : have you ever gotten like any offenses from them?
ch_1 : from customers or <uh> the employees
**ch_0 : <Yeah> those**
**ch_1 : but <um>**
ch_0 : you ever been in a position in a position of a okay employer or you have definitely been a customer. But I don't know if you have been to
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : Heaviness a employee or something.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> I have not been an employee necessarily but <um> I have seen the way that <um> my fellow citizens treat other employees and so I've seen that that doesn't, it isn't always very kind. So if you don't say please, it's not a very big issue
**ch_0 : So**
**ch_1 : very**
ch_0 : what about the tip cultural
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : tip? You need to like give them some tips after their service.
ch_1 : <Yeah> Yes it is it is expected if you don't tip because <yep> the waiters are not paid very well unless it's a very expensive restaurant. So they rely on tipping for most of their wage
ch_0 : So is it kind of necessary in your country?
ch_1 : in a way. Yes there's no if you don't tip <um> they might just think you're a bit rude or you know the maximum. But <um>
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <yep> it's it's it is good to tip even if it's just 10% or 8% you know a dollar or $2 it's not good to tip in some way
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : <um>**
ch_0 : I'm still struggling to say please but when it comes when it comes to tips like I need to give them tips like mandatory. Really I am really alerted because I'm not happy situated like giving them tips or saying please at the end of this order. I'm very alerted.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> <Yeah> but <yeah> it is just I think this is more of a cultural aspect of of the U. S. Which is being tipping <um> like at least Like 8% you know slash 10%. And then typically <um> I mean it's understandable maybe if you weren't satisfied with the service to not tip but
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : <um> and then using using thank you and please especially thank you. I think it's more common than please
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <um> In my opinion that's used. Okay.
ch_0 : So I can <uh> I think we there's only three minutes left for us
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : so I can have one question more. Could you please ask ask me about something?
ch_1 : <Yeah> of course <yeah> of course. <Um> <Oh> what are you <um> what what way what cultural aspects of english speaking countries have you struggled most with in countries?
**ch_0 : <Oh> my God.**
**ch_1 : <Oh> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : As I just mentioned I still struggled a lot with saying thank saying please. And or so like I don't know like I don't really like interacted with people who are english spoken english speakers so I was have been to new Zealand which is a english spoken which is an english spoken country
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : like I was being interacted interacted with them.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : I was culture shocked. My dear open minded behavior. Hear what what I don't think is about the because of the language uses because it's just like I am struggling with or or language barriers of english like not specifically. I'm struggling with specific with number words Holy holy please sing please. It's really hard for me to <uh> subject to ordering
**ch_1 : <mm>**
**ch_0 : no**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : other things. <Uh> not not really not specifically difficult. <Um> I am just I am like struggling with or the things cultured
**ch_1 : <Ah>**
ch_0 : and and english linguistic barrier. You know what what language barrier is? Yes.
ch_1 : Yes yes. So you're struggling with the culture with culture in both english as the language barrier right? The cultural barrier and the language barrier. I see.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Yes it is it can be quite difficult to adapt because it is so different
ch_0 : <Yeah> it's really difficult to adjust, adjust myself to english joe movement.
**ch_1 : but it. <Mhm>**
ch_0 : You know I heard that
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : when you speak english it is required to have a special joe movement but I am not really used to it yet but I'm really trying <um> trying on I might get trying on getting my pronunciation right and clear but it is my best I think
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : for now.**
ch_1 : Yes and I think you're doing great honestly it it can be very difficult especially because there's also a lot of different cultures and different pockets of culture within english speaking countries and so it can be very you know can vary as you enter a certain area versus another one especially in the United States which as you had mentioned is very culturally diverse but you're doing an amazing job and being aware of particular customs such as tipping and saying thank you and please is already a victory in and of itself.
**ch_0 : Thank you.**
**ch_1 : <Mhm> Of course**
ch_0 : I was I was looking for the or the custom I didn't like it didn't come popped up. It didn't pop up on my mind so <Yeah>
ch_1 : <yeah> Absolutely <yeah> these are different and cultural, I will hear cultural customs of the U. S.
**ch_0 : Right. Hm.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> Of course. Well since we've run out of time I'll go ahead and correct this on the feedback report. So I will
ch_0 : So can I ask one more when are you when are you going give, when are you going to give me your feedback right away or you need to take some time.
ch_1 : <um> I likely take some time if you'd like I can actually work on this one right away because I have no other lessons after this. So if you'd like for me to finish this in the next hour I can definitely do that. <Um>
ch_0 : <Oh> my gosh! If you could do that I will be so happy with <um> seeing how you fix my grammatical word, Some awkward sentences into your own
ch_1 : <Yeah> of course <yeah> I can definitely do that. It should be pretty easy to do right now because we only really have to correct this part so I can probably do this in the next 20-30 minutes.
ch_0 : just here and watching sit here and watch your correction? Okay, I'm not gonna bother
**ch_1 : <Ah>**
**ch_0 : in any way.**
ch_1 : <Oh> of course absolutely. <Uh> If you want I think you should be able to see it as I finish the feedback report. Let me see can I accept this without exiting this? Let me see. Okay you can definitely do that. Let me see. Yes okay I can do that. Let me first always asked me to finish to do a different part actually. <Oh> okay I accidentally exited without meaning to. Okay let me I can definitely do that. See if I can here I will not I'm writing down some random stuff in the feedback report. That will not be the final aspect I finished let's say I struggle a lot with thing please. Also I don't interact with people who are english speakers. I was <oh> so here are you okay with staying on zoom and doing this
**ch_0 : Yes, of course.**
ch_1 : or? Okay so instead of saying I was being interacted with them. <um> and I was culture shocked. I so here you're you're setting up that you were interacting with them and culture shocked by their open mind
ch_0 : Yes. It was like
**ch_1 : <um>**
ch_0 : they have really these kind of like
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : having affairs with other people even though they have their girlfriend or their boyfriend and also it is like personal problems. It can be their personal problems that other than that. But more thing that I have encounter that shocked me is the sexual interaction between long them. Like they really too sexual stuff.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : They were open to saying something really nasty like nerdy.
ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah> they were more open with like this thing with sexual innuendos or with implying things or even with flirting, they were more direct
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : than others. <Yeah> that tends to be, I think <um> Western culture tends to be more, the word is touchy feely or more yet more direct and more.
ch_0 : Kiss kissy. Like more kissy, they kiss on their cheeks.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm> Yes. <Mhm> <yep> And while it may be that isn't super common in greeting, it is common to do that with loved ones or with family members in public. Very very common <um>
**ch_0 : Really?**
ch_1 : <Mhm> Especially if you are coming from an ethnic household as well. So for example I'm mexican american, so in Mexico it's very common to greet with kissing on the cheek and with <um> you know if the guy will sometimes hold hands with my mom while walking down the street <um> and things like that are very common. <Um> But I think it depends on culture as you said, but Western culture the whole does seem to be more touchy feely. So just to correct it. So when I interacted with them
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : right, because you're you're trying to signal that during this interaction, that's when you realize that when I interacted with them, I was culture shocked full shop by their open minded mindedness, right?
**ch_0 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : <Uh> And I'm struggling with all barriers <Um> I would say I'm struggling with all barriers of english, not specifically not not just specific words. All of this can likely just be put just right, we're basically how do I? There we go. Okay, so not just specific words makes a little bit more sense here. It makes it flow better. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So because you've already said that you're struggling and you're specifying not just specific words so you don't necessarily need to repeat.
ch_0 : Well, I I was I was saying like I am struggling with or the Or the words of English not specifically one.
ch_1 : <Yeah> that's not specifically precisely. So you're the not. Right? So not is here. So if this if this not were not included here then it would it would say the opposite. It would say you are only struggling with specific words but you say you are not, it's not just specific word.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So this is telling you this is more than just one or two words. This is a lot of
**ch_0 : All right.**
ch_1 : so not just specific words. So then I am struggling with all the things <um> all the things cultural <uh> and english as a language barrier here. The way that this is grammatically correct. But the way that I would rephrase it is I am struggling with multiple
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> with multiple things is a bit informal. So maybe instead of things we want to say with multiple <um> factors as an example factors, features you know
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : <um>**
**ch_0 : For two factors,**
ch_1 : cultural and <um> maybe language wise as an example, we offer a different paraphrase of this. I want to offer multiple because it sounds a bit strange. I am struggling with multiple <um> factors. <Um> Such as like cultural, yes, such as cultural and language barriers,
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : right? Such as being a suggestion such as an example or including including cultural language barriers. So that is why I would rephrase these.
ch_0 : I have a lot of like abroad of vocabulary in my mind, but I don't use them since I don't use them. I don't need like
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : memorize more words.**
**ch_1 : <Mhm> I think,**
ch_0 : I didn't like I didn't know factors what I don't I know what it means, but I don't really use in my conversation or my looks.
ch_1 : <yeah> I think it is uncommon to use in casual english, you might hear it when more formal english, if you're explaining to a boss for example or a supervisor, you might use factors if you're, you know, giving a presentation will use factors. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <yeah> if you're in a classroom, you know, speaking with a lot of peers at your, you know education level but you're in a formal setting such as a classroom or a seminar you'd use it right, even if you're not necessarily presenting,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : but if you're with your friends, you know eating, you're not you're probably not going to
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> it will depend.
ch_0 : So I think I don't want to like taking I don't want to take your time more and we need to wrap it up. But what works?
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : Question that I can <uh> if you could score my English level 1-10 what would you what level would you give me?
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <Oh> I'd probably give you an eight
**ch_0 : Eight?**
ch_1 : I think. And it would be pretty <yeah> because I think that <um> I think there is some some minor grammatical mistakes that can occur commit but they seem to be very small And there's some formal English that some formal, some lack of formality but as a whole you seem to be doing very well and I think if you just expand your vocabulary a little bit more then I think you would get up to a nine or a 10 pretty easily.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> because of like
**ch_1 : <Um> <hmm>**
ch_0 : I need to retrieve the words really quick because that like I can use my vocabulary
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : with all my ability
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : but the reality is more is the most important key in speaking english since then I need to try on more and more I think.
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : So it was really nice to nice talking with you. I will give you five stars on.
**ch_1 : <Yeah> of course**
**ch_0 : Of course**
ch_1 : encourage me. <Yeah> Thank you. Absolutely. I would say like of course it's great, it was great to help you.
ch_0 : definitely. <Yeah> it was really nice ever.
**ch_1 : <Um> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : It was the most you you were the most like
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
