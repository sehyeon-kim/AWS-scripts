 : 
**ch_1 : I dua**
**ch_0 : Hi.**
ch_1 : hello? Hello, what's happening? How are you?
ch_0 : <Um> Pretty good I suppose.
ch_1 : That's <yeah> that's amazing to hear a long time to speak. I was like if what have you been up to?
ch_0 : Well nothing in particularly but <uh> luckily for me <uh> summer vacation is starting in about two weeks or so.
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : thanks. That's exciting. Do you have any plans for this summer?
ch_0 : <Um> Well we are my folks and I are planning to visit jeju island on august <um> <Yeah> I forgot the exact date, but it's somewhere like there in the middle of august.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> <Yeah> awesome, awesome. What's that gonna entail for you? Like just lots of lying on the beach and getting tanned or or are you more of an active kind of vacationer? Do you go hiking? Do you, I hear that people volunteer on, on farms in jeju so I don't know if that's something you're into. What are the activities that you're gonna do, you're gonna pursue in jeju?
ch_0 : <Mhm> Well we're definitely going to visit the beach <um> but mostly I'm looking forward for the food. <Um> <Yeah> I'm not much of an athlete as you probably already know, so I won't be doing any hiking. <Um>
ch_1 : <Mhm> I won't judge
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> so I suppose most I will mostly be just stuffing my belly during the whole trip trip. <Yeah>
ch_1 : that actually sounds, it actually sounds amazing. <Yeah> What some typical gg food, like what's what's the food like?
ch_0 : I have no idea, I only went there once when I was like a toddler, so. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Huh> <Yeah> Right. Right. <Yeah> He is quite different from like mainland korean though, right? Like judges a little bit like its own kind of culture almost. Right. <Yeah> They even have like their own,
ch_0 : Yes. <Yeah> They have their own accent.
ch_1 : they even have their own language technically right? Like there is not just like a korean accent.
ch_0 : <Yeah> I know it's so different from like the <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Yeah> <Yeah> Exactly. Right. But it's it's actually an endangered language which is kind of sad because there's not a lot of like native speakers and most people who are native speakers also speak korean. So that's always the issue. It's the same with like irish or Okinawan with the language as well.
**ch_0 : Okay. <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : It's always it's always sad to see that because I'm gonna be going to? Okinawa actually also in august
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : right, I'm also excited for the food. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : and like my my partner, my partner, sometimes they like hiking, but sometimes they don't like hiking. I really love hiking. So I'm hoping that there will be a little bit of hiking, but it's going to be a bit of a compromise probably. So we'll see how much hiking it's going to happen in Okinawa.
ch_0 : <Huh> Okay. I wish you the best. <Um> Although I don't really get why you'd want to climb a mountain when you're on a vacation. <Um> <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Yeah> Thank you. Thank you. I don't know. I think I just, I'm a bit of a masochist. I just like feeling pain in my legs and those kind of things, you know, that's the basic idea.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Uh> So you like feeling pain in your legs? Okay.
**ch_1 : <Yeah> definitely, definitely.**
ch_0 : <Um> <Yeah> Okay. Well that sounds a little bit strange but <Yeah>
ch_1 : Right, ready. There you go. I think that's like for for all people who like sports, that's the case. Let's talk about not traveling to east asian islands. Let's talk about traveling to France. What Got you interested in that topic?
ch_0 : Okay. <Uh> Well you know I <um> well I think it wasn't just in the main browser page so I just kind of selected it because I mean it looked like it it was pretty easy and it
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : looked as if it didn't contain really <uh> look at if it contained a really short article with easy questions so that is
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm> <mm>**
ch_0 : the primary reason why I chose this article.
ch_1 : point. Fair point. Taking it easy. I see. Have you ever been to France or would you, would you ever like to go?
ch_0 : <Yeah> So that was the first question and because I was so young with my folks and I had visited friends. I have no memory of friends at all. I am often reminded by my parents of the one time I fell asleep, fell asleep in front of the mona lisa. So <yeah>
ch_1 : <Mm> <Yeah> I mean that's a that's quite that's quite an interesting occasion. Right?
**ch_0 : Yes. <Um>**
ch_1 : <Um> <huh> go on.
ch_0 : <yeah> it was quite humiliating actually. I mean <um>
ch_1 : No, like, like, like, like okay,
**ch_0 : <uh>**
**ch_1 : continue, continue.**
ch_0 : <yeah> I mean what kind of a person falls will sleep in front of the mona lisa. Well I mean I'm that person technically but you know.
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
**ch_0 : <Huh>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> I mean, I'm gonna be honest, you know, <uh> like in the louver itself, the mona lisa is not that spectacular actually right. <Um> it's it's it's it's, it's kind of more the kind of global fame of that painting that's really driving it, you know, it's, it's many and many people say that, right? Like if you, if you talk to people
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> they will say that the mona lisa is actually a little bit disappointing. And also it's like in a it's in a room with a lot of other you know, actually much bigger and and much more exciting paintings. Right?
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So, so in that regard it kind of makes sense that you fell asleep. Right? And especially if you were very if you were so young, you don't actually remember. That means you must have been like, you know, a toddler. <Uh> so you're much more honest, you know, like when when it comes to critiquing art at that age, I guess.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Um> would you like to, would you like to ever visit again? Would you like to retrace your your footsteps in paris
ch_0 : <Oh> of course. I heard there are many five star restaurants at France and I'd like to visit them all.
ch_1 : <mm> Her point. Why why why the obsession with five star restaurants?
ch_0 : Well usually restaurants that have the rate of five stars they usually serve <um> voted that is not yesterday's piece of hot dog. I mean
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> the fact that the restaurant has five stars on its review proves that it serves good food and treats their customers
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : nicely. Yes.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> So when you're saying five star restaurants, are we talking five stars on Trip Advisor? Or are we talking about restaurants that have received a mission Landstar?
**ch_0 : <Oh> well.**
ch_1 : What? five Michelin Stars?
ch_0 : <Um> I was just kind of <um> expressing it was just kind of like an expression of sorts that like <um> I want to visit a restaurant that has been rated <um> high scores by the customers who have already visited the restaurant.
ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm> <mm> Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. Right. Right. Do you feel like do you, do you feel like korean restaurants around you get really bad customer reviews or do you usually find a lot of bad restaurants for new travel?
ch_0 : <Um> <Oh> not really. But <um> still <um>
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : <um> Well, <huh> so korean restaurants <um> they usually don't have bad customer service but
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : well sometimes the food can be a bit <um> I don't know, you know kind of how do you say it was she wash you? Well that's not usually an expression used for food.
ch_1 : Now we don't say that for food. We say that for people who are not clear on what?
ch_0 : <Yeah> but it really felt wishy washy so <yeah>
ch_1 : Okay, okay. <Yeah> a little bit lackluster. A little bit loveless. Maybe you might call it. Okay, Okay, fair point. What's your, what's your impression of french food in general? Like what's kind of your stereotype, your bias? That's your whole.
ch_0 : <Yeah> they eat snails,
ch_1 : <Mm> They do. Have you ever tried snails?
**ch_0 : nope.**
ch_1 : Would you like to?
ch_0 : <Yeah> I heard it was pretty good.
ch_1 : <Yeah> I mean different people say different things. I kind of like snails again, my partner really doesn't like them that much. <Um> what other things like, you know, apart from, you know, well let's, let's get that out of the way. It's snails and frog legs, but apart from snails and frog legs, what else do french people eat in your perception,
**ch_0 : <Um> at claire's**
ch_1 : sexually? That's actually like, okay, so, so you don't find a lot of players in paris, Let me tell you that.
**ch_0 : what? Okay. <Um>**
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : did they at least eat like <um> <um> macaroons maybe?
ch_1 : <Yeah> Macaron. <Yeah> there definitely, that's definitely a thing. <Um> you'll find obviously <um> croissant, right? Like, I mean, you know, french bakery for the french bakery art is amazing, right? And declare is definitely a part of that.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : It's just, I feel compared to other, you're like the french, invented the claire, but they're not as excited about it as let's say the british or the Germans who are massive enthusiasts of a class, honestly.
**ch_0 : <Oh> okay.**
ch_1 : So, <um> <yeah> that's like, you will find good declare, right? But I, I feel like there are other things in, in paris, like definitely the croissants are amazing. I highly recommend that. <Um> Alright, what about four meals? Like, like what, what, what's your image of kind of like a French dinner.
ch_0 : They have 38 courses. <Yeah> just choking but I heard that there were restaurants that had
**ch_1 : <Uh> <huh>**
ch_0 : quite a lot of courses during the meal and
**ch_1 : <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <yeah> I don't know. I have no idea if it's a stereotype or if it's a fact though.
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> I mean the french definitely sort of like invented, you know, the old cuisine, right? Like the sort of like high level <um> cooking and stuff, right? And a lot of, a lot of the top chefs of the world are trained in France.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : My like my personal, my personal perception of, you know, even that sort of high class french cuisine and it might be because it's so global at this point, it doesn't really have sort of a typical french character. It's a very, I don't know like culturally, how would I describe a culturally stay royal cuisine in a way? You know, it's like it doesn't have, it doesn't have like, like you don't eat it. And you say, <oh> that's french. You know the way that you, you know like you can, if you have, if you have like chigir or
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : or something, you know, or bulgogi like you, you say, <oh> that's korean, right? Or if you have, you know, sashimi or nam and you go like, <oh> that's japanese
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : or even when you have like pasta and pizza, you go like, <oh> that's italian. But you know,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I feel like you don't have that knee jerk reaction and french food. It's a very,
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : it's good food. But you know like it's, it's, there's nothing that makes it like inherently french to me that's my personal perception of french food in a way, but I might be biased because I'm, I'm half british, half german, so you know, a long history of hating the french beard.
ch_0 : <mm> ha ha ha.
ch_1 : Right? But <yeah> definitely. I think it's definitely worth, you know, trying. <Um> but you have to spend a lot of money if you want to have like the, you know, like the 43 course meals, that kind of like a jacuzzi and stuff. <Um> but when we talk about traveling in general, what's your absolute dream destination?
ch_0 : Okay so while I have numerous places that I would love to visit gun to my head it would probably be Japan
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : as an enemy enthusiast as you probably already know. I have always longed for a chance to visit this small peninsula and sadly I didn't get a chance. We'll wait just a sec. Is Japan a penance. No, never mind. It's an island. <Um> <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Yeah> I was, I was about to write that. I was about to write that down for correction. Exactly.
ch_0 : I take the rock and roll. <Yeah> Sally, I'm not that good at geography. Yes. <Um> And I did not get a chance to travel around much the past few years due to covid. <Um> And now that the pandemic is close to its end.
**ch_1 : No worries. <Uh>**
ch_0 : I sincerely hope that I would be able to travel to Japan soon.
ch_1 : <mm> <Yeah> The point if you, if you were to go to Japan, like what would be some of like your, what would be on your bucket list? You know, you have a week in Japan, what, what do you need to do?
ch_0 : Well I need to visit all the famous restaurants in Tokyo obviously <um> and I want to visit like studio deeply like the
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : building of the studio and
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : I don't know maybe visit a few other places that's related to anime or <um>
**ch_1 : <Uh> <huh>**
ch_0 : <yeah> maybe it is some dessert shops as well. I <um> I was born with the sweet tooth so I always craving
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : something with sugar in it.
ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm> <Yeah> my, my Japanese University actually was literally right next to Ghibli studios, right next to jubilee studios.
**ch_0 : Seriously?**
ch_1 : <Um> so <yeah> definitely recommend visiting because it's, it's really cool actually. And also like, I think Miyazaki and is one of the
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : probably still one of the best story writers of our time. 100 movie?
ch_0 : <Yeah> well that question is kind of asking me to choose between my mom and dad but
ch_1 : <Mm> well you might have a favorite parent?
ch_0 : If I had to pick one don't remind me. Okay anyways <um> <uh> I suppose it would be house moving castle maybe
ch_1 : <Mm> good choice. Very good choices. Very good choice. <Yeah> <Um> I, I totally agree. Well not quite like for me it would be, <um> what's it called?
**ch_0 : spirit away**
ch_1 : Yes. Spirited away. Exactly. I, I would forget the english title.
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : <Um> I think that's my favorite one because like, like I still, I still sometimes have nightmares of the faceless thing.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : And I think if, if, if like if a story can evoke, you know that level of memory like that. Such a deep impressive memory in you. It has to be a really good movie.
**ch_0 : Okay**
ch_1 : So that's why <um> <yeah> Spirited Away would definitely be my choice.
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : That's a good one. in terms of, you know, you said all the famous restaurants
**ch_0 : <mhm> <mhm>**
ch_1 : talk about some, maybe maybe I can find some inspiration of like places that I want to go to.
ch_0 : <uh> well I don't know like any names the, well I definitely have to visit like a place that sounds like a japanese ramen obviously <um>
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_0 : <yeah> and sushi probably <um> and
**ch_1 : <mm> <Yeah>**
ch_0 : well how do you say that in english? Just let me search it out. <Ah>
ch_1 : Well you can also say it in japanese like
ch_0 : but <um> well that, I don't know if like wow. <Huh> just a sec <um> Taco yaki
ch_1 : can you please call it Tako Yaki.
ch_0 : okay so well I tried to do a english pronunciation, don't blame me.
ch_1 : <Yeah> Don't just, just, you can, you can do a normal pronunciation for me. Like I speak japanese like that's okay.
**ch_0 : Okay <yep>**
ch_1 : <Mm> Exactly. <Yeah> you should go to Osaka for that. Honestly, like Osaka is the best damn to Chiaki.
ch_0 : wow whoa that would cost me a lot of money. <Huh> <yep>
ch_1 : <Mm> I mean you could, you could just go to to, to, you know, do sort of like a couple of days in Tokyo and then you know a couple, I don't know, like four days in Tokyo, three days in or so
ch_0 : <Yeah> maybe or I can just borrow my parents budget
ch_1 : definitely worth a visit. <Yeah> I mean, you know going to Japan is not going to be cheap anyway. You know, like even if you just stay in one city. Absolutely,
**ch_0 : <yep>**
ch_1 : absolutely. <Yeah> fair point. Fair point, fair point. Right. Any favorite japanese sweets because you said you had quite the sweet tooth
ch_0 : <huh> <um> <mhm> I actually don't know many like japanese sweets but I heard that it was like candy banana in Japan like you know <uh>
**ch_1 : candy, banana.**
ch_0 : well not really. Candy banana, it's sort of like chocolate banana with like a banana with like a chocolate covering.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <yeah> right. Like I know, I know one brand that does it, which is called Tokyo banana or Tokyo banana. <Um> Exactly. It's, it's almost like a,
**ch_0 : No <yeah>**
ch_1 : it's like, it's like a sponge cake, it's a really fluffy sponge cake filled with like banana cream and chocolate on it. So
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <yeah> but it's not that amazing if I'm honest.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> Okay.**
ch_1 : But <yeah> no, 100% 100%. You should definitely also try out some of the more traditional japanese sweets, right? Like the things like dive cu, which is like rice cake with <um> with red bean paste in the middle,
ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> <yeah> <yeah>
ch_1 : right, that kind of stuff. <Um> I mean probably there are also like a lot of things that remind you of, you know, sort of like <um> similar, similar korean things because I feel like especially the modern dessert cultures, like japan has a lot of like the modern korean desserts, like macaroons are huge in japan right now, everyone's crazy about macron's bound. <Um> I've heard that before
ch_0 : What, what language is that?
ch_1 : or well it's technically Japanese if I pronounced bal mcu him. <Um> so this is actually a funny story because it originated, it originally comes from Germany <uh> and then there was this german baker who went to japan before or during World War two, married, a japanese person stayed in japan after the war and started making bomb Kuhan in japan and then his family sort of like expanded the business and Japan nowadays makes better than the Germans. So
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : and it's something that Japanese people are crazy about honestly like
ch_0 : Okay, so what kind of a dessert is it?
ch_1 : people, it's <um> it's it's a very light kind of layered cake with like really thin layers, right? Like so you usually have like a cake layer and then a chocolate layer, very thin chocolate layer cake layer, chocolate layer, cake layer, chocolate layer. And the
ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> <yeah> <yeah> we have something similar to that in Korea.
ch_1 : <Yeah> right. And kind of like if you translated it translates into a tree cake, tree cake and the reason the reason you call it that is <um> it's sort of like in a in a round format. Most cakes aren't around format obviously right, but if you cut it open and it looks like the rings of a tree, you know
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : like when you cut open a tree, like you have the, the earrings right? Like the growth rings and that's why it's called tree cake,
**ch_0 : <ah>**
ch_1 : I can write that down for you actually
ch_0 : <yep> Tom cool hand. <Yeah> that is definitely hard to pronounce especially because it's like german
ch_1 : because it's exactly because it's a german word, right? Like the funny thing is like the first, the first, the first time that somebody asked me about it, like I heard the japanese pronunciation and I was so lost. I did not know what people were talking about
**ch_0 : yes**
ch_1 : only to find out that it's a german cake actually. <Um> But <yeah> that's the that's that's something I think that's something that's also really nice to try in Japan as far as desserts go?
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah> but then sort of like when it comes to traveling in general, <um> how do you, how do you prefer to, to, to travel sort of like what are, what are some of your, your tips so to speak?
ch_0 : okay, so I visited quite a lot of places over the years and they were all delightful each in their own way. <Um> however there were some very uncomfortable experiences along the way as well. <Um> The best travel tip that I can probably give you is that pictures on the <yeah> so you should never ever under any circumstances trust the pictures on the hotel website or the browser. People have developed quite a few Photoshop techniques over the years and so it is quite dangerous to trust first impressions especially if it is online.
ch_1 : <Mm> <mm> So how do you make, how do you select a good hotel then? How do you make sure that that it's actually good.
ch_0 : <Um> Well you have to take a look at the reviews and if <uh> you're friends with someone who have already <uh> have experienced that <uh> of like going to that place is the place you want to visit for vacation. You should ask them for like travel tips maybe ask them to like drop down the place they had stayed in
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <mm> <mm>**
ch_0 : while they were visiting the place.
ch_1 : <mm> <hmm> <Yeah> sure. And <um> so do you, do you usually prefer to stay in hotels or do you, do you also, have you, have you ever tried other sort of like kind of accommodations like Airbnb or I don't know, probably probably mostly you've been traveling like with, with other adults. Right?
**ch_0 : Yes**
ch_1 : So I guess hostels you've not tried, but I was like, what kind of kind of accommodations have you have you stayed in?
ch_0 : we usually stayed in like hotels. So <um> I've, no I've never gone camping and <um> well
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : we stated <uh> cruise one time when I was really young but I can't really remember.
ch_1 : <mm> Like on a ship basically?
ch_0 : Well yes are like on a ship.
**ch_1 : <Um>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> Well I have to sleep inside a plane one time because like while I was making the transition from the United States to Korea it was like night time technically <um>
**ch_1 : <mm> <mm>**
ch_0 : american thai wise. So <um>
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : <yeah> <um> I had to sleep inside the plane and it was quite uncomfortable with my mask and all but I survived through it. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Mhm> <mm> <Yeah> <Yeah> I, I can never really sleep on a, on a, on a plane honestly. Like it's, I have a very, I have very shallow sleep on, on transport in general. I also can't really sleep in castle on trains. <Um> And <yeah> it's like I, I end up just not sleeping and then I sleep a whole lot when I've landed. That's kind of my strategy there definitely when it comes to hotels. So do you prefer sort of like resort hotels that have, you know like a pool and all kinds of entertainment included
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : or do you prefer being you know in a more low key hotel and then you know explore the area and sort of like <um> take in the entertainment that you know like the plight the bigger town city, it was sort of like place offers
ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> I definitely like the first option the resort. <Um> While I was visiting Cancun I stayed in the hotel resort with my family most of for most of
**ch_1 : Cape Town.**
**ch_0 : king kou**
**ch_1 : Cancun okay. <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <yeah> what in the world is kei kun? Okay. <Ah>
ch_1 : Did you say wait, you said said Cancun. Right
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : Cancun, okay. <Yeah> Mr announcer sorry?
ch_0 : <Yeah> you said you thought I said like cake or something
ch_1 : No, no before that it was Cape Town. I thought it was Cape Town.
ch_0 : cake town. What in the world is Cape Town?
ch_1 : Cape Town. That is the second largest city of South Africa.
ch_0 : Okay so I have no idea what that is. <Yeah>
ch_1 : Well it's this, I just told you the second South Africa is a country, you know, which happens to be the most southern country in Africa
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : and the second largest city in South Africa is Cape Town on it's the most southern city of Africa as well. It's right in the South or South Africa,
**ch_0 : Okay. So**
**ch_1 : that's Cape Town.**
ch_0 : <yeah> I don't think I've been needing that information anytime soon though.
ch_1 : There you go, that's that. You didn't know what it was. So I thought I'd tell you right, what about Cancun though? Like what was the hotel like?
ch_0 : Well true. It was really good. <Um> I heard that it was really expensive. <Um>
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> so <um> we paid the money beforehand so we could basically visit any restaurants with inside the hotel without paying money. And it was that was really nice. There was this big dessert shops
**ch_1 : <mhm> More**
ch_0 : that I loved <um> like I mentioned I have a sweet I had a sweet juice ever since I was born into this world.
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> there were like chocolate marshmallows and candied apples and ice cream and macaroons. And it was basically heaven.
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <mm>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : there was this big pool as well and a lot of other things as well probably. But <um> <yeah> that's as far as I can remember, it was like about two years ago so I can't remember exactly.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <mm> <hmm> Do you, when you go travel, do you prefer sort of like traveling to more remote? You know kind of like laid back destinations or do you prefer cities?
ch_0 : I definitely prefer traveling to. <Um> Well I haven't wait actually. Well there are pros and cons to each destination because obviously in the cities you can see famous tourist attractions. However in the countryside <uh> the
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : atmosphere is definitely more relaxed. There are less towards and you can just kind of enjoy the view. Like the
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : <uh> not true aspects of like the talent and stuff.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> so the <um> well there would definitely be a lot of things to see in the city. <Um> but it be really crowded and kind of uncomfortable at times. <Um>
**ch_1 : <mm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and you know if you just kind of stay at remote places it's it could be quite boring but there would be less people and you might actually have a more endurable experience than staying in the city.
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So it is said gun to your head, Which one do you prefer?
ch_0 : <Oh> well that's a hard question. <Um> Well let's just imagine that I really have a gun to my head. It would probably be the city definitely because there is going to be more dessert shops at the city definitely.
ch_1 : I see I see boils down to the dessert again. I see I see I see.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : Point point. <Yeah> <Um> <mhm> In in the future, right? Like once you can travel more freely <um> do you think you would like to want to go on a trip on your own just by yourself or do you, do you think it would still be better to just you know, travel with friends? Travel with other people?
ch_0 : What I think it would be definitely better for me to travel with other people <uh> because I tend to get lost a lot and you know, if I'm just kind of dumped on a country that I've never been to. <Yeah> I'd probably be, <uh>
**ch_1 : <Mm> <mhm>**
ch_0 : no, like taking to the police station or something.
ch_1 : How could you prevent that?
ch_0 : There's basically no way to prevent that. Well, maybe, <um> maybe someone can leave like trails of candy on the road ahead of time and I can just fall back.
ch_1 : Don't you have will maps also? Okay, okay. Hey, <yeah> piece of advice like don't follow trails of candy on the road and don't take candy from strangers please. Like that stuff's dangerous honestly. <Um>
ch_0 : Okay. The first thing is,
ch_1 : but don't you don't you have google maps also.
ch_0 : I don't know how to use maps to be honest. <Yeah> my mother tried to teach me, but
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : <yeah> no use. <Um>
**ch_1 : <uh> <huh>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> I honestly have no idea how I survived like 12 years.
**ch_1 : four.**
**ch_0 : <Uh> <huh>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> I mean that's the nice thing of you know like traveling with your parents, right? Like you can just tag along most of the time definitely.
**ch_0 : Exactly.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> fair point fair point. I think a lot of the time you know like when it comes to things like map reading also, most people don't learn that specifically, right? I always find it kind of weird <um> when when parents try to teach, you know their their Children how to read like that stuff comes out of necessity. You know like once you like eventually you are going to be alone somewhere. You know and you have to find your way around so you'll just figure it out and honestly like here's the truth. Like it's actually not that hard to read google maps, you know you'll you'll get there so I don't think that's something you need to worry about.
ch_0 : Okay. But the problem is I probably have to use neighbor maps now that I have in Korea.
ch_1 : <Um> It's right. Right. <Yeah> I don't know how good that is.
ch_0 : <Yeah> I honestly have no idea how good that is either.
ch_1 : <Ah> <Yeah> but I think when you're abroad like you're gonna you're gonna have access to to google maps. Honestly like
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I like something that something that I actually like to do when I travel, especially when I travel alone, I just walk in one direction that looks interesting and after after 45 minutes or after an hour of walking I just look on google maps, see where I am and then I go like to the next to the next place that the map kind of shows me and eventually I'll just figure out my way home with google maps <um> because that's a really cool way to like see interesting places you you know you get away from like all the touristy spots because let's be honest touristy spots can be a little bit overwhelming and they're super crowded. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : And <um> you know as long as you don't if you make sure you don't wander into like too dangerous sort of like shifty areas <um> You can have a really good time with that approach. So big recommendation there, you know just just get lost on purpose
ch_0 : <hmm> Well I can do that.
ch_1 : but don't follow me. <Yeah> <Yeah> exactly right? Like if you use that as a as a kind of superpower. Don't see that as a weakness. See that as an opportunity for, you know, making interesting experiences but please do not, you know, follow
**ch_0 : Candy trails.**
**ch_1 : candy. <Yeah> No.**
ch_0 : <Yeah> I learned a lesson from reading Hansel and Gretel, don't worry.
ch_1 : Okay. <Yeah> exactly. Right. So like that there's a, there's a moral behind that story, right? And the best way to avoid the witches not to get trapped in the first place. <Um> writing,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : let's do, let's do a little bit of language feedback for the rest of our time. You ready?
**ch_0 : <Huh> Okay.**
ch_1 : <Oh> can you see either the less notes and everything?
ch_0 : Just a sec. <Uh> it's loading. <Yeah> <yep>
ch_1 : Perfect. So let's have a look at number one here. I was just on the main browsing browser page and you were kind of talking about, you know, selecting the topic. So I was thinking main browser page is kind of weird because it's on,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : what do you think?
ch_0 : <Um> on the home page maybe. I don't know.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <yeah> exactly, exactly. Right. On the home page. On the, on the landing page or on the main page. Those are the two
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : the three most, you know, standard words that we use there definitely look at this one. They're usually so food. That's not yesterday's hot dog.
ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> I pretty said like piece of hot dog.
ch_1 : <Yeah> piece of hot dog. Thank you. Right. Peace off. I kind of miss type that. I'm not sure if this is like, I'm pretty sure it's not, let's find, let's find kind of like a more general or more idiomatic phrase for this?
ch_0 : <Mm> <um> that is not, <um> does he have a phrase for this?
ch_1 : Well there's technically like kind of for what you want to say. Right? Like food from yesterday. How would you describe that in terms of adjectives.
ch_0 : <Uh> that's not, <um> leftovers from yesterday or something? I don't know,
ch_1 : Okay. <Yeah> of course. Right? Like internationally column, that's not, not just yesterday's leftovers, definitely
**ch_0 : left over.**
ch_1 : after all, let's go with that, right? Some suggestions that, you know, we could say that's not, that's not, you know, stale dry and <um> you know, wilted. Well <yeah> I wouldn't go as far as to say rotten, Right? I think I hope that, you know, things don't, you know, but like
**ch_0 : <Um> Rotten. <Yeah>**
ch_1 : stale dry and and wilted. I think those are, you know, you can still eat it, but it's not as advertising anymore.
**ch_0 : <Mm> Okay.**
ch_1 : Right? Without the h by the way. Right? Let's have a look at number three, right, with the word five star restaurants and you remember it was a bit confused because when we talk about, when we talk about five star hotels, right? That's kind of like category of hotels for restaurants, it's a little bit different. Especially when we talk about stars in the context of restaurants, we talk about michelin stars.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So for what you wanted to express how how can we say this, avoiding, you know, the word five start here.
ch_0 : Maybe like maybe just say like famous restaurants or
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <um> so there are a lot of restaurants in parasite is famous for their, <um> filled, right?
**ch_1 : <yeah> renowned.**
ch_0 : There are restaurants famous for like France cuisine or something. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Mm> You could call them renowned, right? Or you could just say, you know, reputable actually reputable and I should probably ride restaurants at the end. <Yeah> those are definitely all words that you could use that. It fits really, really well. Let's have a look at this one. This is a very small one. <Um> We don't say under any circumstances
**ch_0 : Really?**
ch_1 : <yeah> we stay under any
ch_0 : And it sounds like in we're in or like in the US?
ch_1 : <Mhm> No no no no no no no I'm pretty sure we always say under any circumstance
**ch_0 : <Huh> Okay.**
ch_1 : we don't use the because we use the plural, we don't use the plural here. Right? It's it's under any circumstance.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> I think it's speaking it's not that much of a problem but because you wrote down the answer, I wanted to point it out under any circumstances and circumstance. <Yeah>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Uh> Seven. Look at number four sorry five. Beforehand. Is there a fancier word?
ch_0 : <Oh> prior to <um> <um> staying at the hotel maybe. I don't know
ch_1 : How About one Word?
**ch_0 : one word. <Um>**
ch_1 : Kind of like <yeah> I'm already I'm actually lying is not one word. It's what I'm thinking is two word but like shorter than saying you know prior to arriving at the hotel or something.
ch_0 : <um> He <um> well it's definitely like initially or previously that those are conjunctions <um>
**ch_1 : In a**
**ch_0 : <um>**
ch_1 : <yeah> it doesn't fit quite well here. We'll probably just say in advance as as I said I lied a little bit. It's not one word, it's two words. But <um> Right. That's definitely a funny fancy word you can use here.
**ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Last last one. Let's have a look at number six if I'm dumped on a country. <Um>
ch_0 : <Uh> dumped out of country would be technically the right preposition first but
**ch_1 : Not at**
**ch_0 : the <yeah>**
**ch_1 : in**
**ch_0 : In. <Oh> <yeah>**
ch_1 : <yeah> in a country, right
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : but how can we say this is a bit nicer right? Like this sounds like your your parents really like just want to get rid of you and you you know they kick you out of the car and then leave.
ch_0 : <Yeah> Well I don't know if this <uh> this might sound just as worse but like if I am left alone or maybe if I'm stranded on a country out of
ch_1 : <Yeah> that was actually the that was exactly the if I'm stranded or if I find myself stranded right? Find myself stranded <um> in a country I've never into. Exactly right. This is a very common expression we use in this situation, right? If I found myself stranded in the city, I've never been to write. Although originally, you know, Stranding has to do with like deserted islands and stuff. Well, we've come to use that term a lot more generally. Right? <Um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So <yeah> that fits really well. There we go. Do our do you have any final questions for me today?
**ch_0 : <Uh> nope.**
ch_1 : Good staff. Then we'll have a good rest of the week. Right? And enjoy the summer holidays in general. Right. Summer vacation and such. See you around. Take care.
