 : 
**ch_1 : Hi,**
**ch_0 : Hi**
ch_1 : how are you doing today?
ch_0 : I'm doing well. <Yeah> it is <uh> evening here.
**ch_1 : Hey**
ch_0 : So this is smart. <Yeah> sorry
ch_1 : how late is it? How late is it right now, What time is it?
ch_0 : It is 11 p.m.
ch_1 : <Oh> wow, it's really late.
ch_0 : At night. This is my last schedule of today.
ch_1 : Okay, hopefully you can get some sleep.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> Thank you.**
ch_1 : Okay, so I usually like to start off doing a little bit of introductions, so my name is Rachel, I'm a rising senior at Tufts University in boston massachusetts. I study public health and I plan to go to medical school after I graduate from college <um> and I joined Ringel, I just love english, I love speaking, I love helping people feel more confident. I just want people to feel like they can have conversations about anything with anyone. I think it can be really empowering and <yeah> I'd like to know a little bit more about you.
ch_0 : Hi Rachel. My name is and I'm living in Seoul South Korea and I'm working as a software engineer in startups in Korea And <um> I graduated from Korea University two years ago and my major was computer science and engineering.
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : And the reason why I started Ringo is to one of one of my goals is to move abroad and get a job in foreign countries or study abroad in graduate school. To achieve that goal, I have to improve my english skill but I don't have much chance to speak in english in my current situation
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and and I I also need some <uh> accurate feedback from native native native speakers and and for those reasons I think that's why I do Ringle for for a year so far.
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : And in my free time I like reading books running in the park and playing acoustic guitar and I hope today we have a fruitful discussion together. Thank you.
ch_1 : awesome. Okay, well it's really nice to meet you <um> Okay, do you feel like Ringo has been helpful so far with helping you improve your english?
ch_0 : <Yeah> sure of course. <Uh> many tutors gave me some very detailed feedbacks that I've never thought or noticed, so it was really helpful. <Mm>
ch_1 : Okay, that's good to hear. Okay, so I see that today <um> focusing on fluency vocabulary grammar <um> and paraphrasing english to make it sound more native. Okay, amazing. <Mhm> Okay, so we can start off, I see that this article is about what it means to be well spoken very topical for what we're doing today.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_1 : Okay, so in which situations do you feel less confident speaking english?
ch_0 : <Um> There are a few situations that I felt less confident <um> first <um> when I have to talk about some topics which I don't have enough backgrounds or some cultures that I've never experienced and and audiences who who I've never been so far. I've never met so far then I think in those situations it is really difficult to speak confident confident confidently because I cannot strong I cannot <uh> I can assure my opinion strongly because we both of us have really different thoughts and I also have to consider <uh> the opponent situation and background circumstances so there are many variables when I when I give a speech. So in that situation I think I became I became less confident.
ch_1 : Okay, okay, great answer. Alright, I really liked <um> one thing that I noticed that you did was you self corrected <um> which I think is a really, really good thing, so for example when you said <um> it is really difficult to speak confident and then you kind of wavered on that word and then you said confidently that was really appreciated because it's like you're working to I guess make sure that you're using the correct adjectives. <Um> and also you're like it's
**ch_0 : <Ah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : it's definitely a native characteristic to be able to hear something and be like <oh> that doesn't sound right <um> and then self correct based on that, so that's already really impressive.
**ch_0 : Not thank you**
ch_1 : Okay, so we can start off so there are a few sentences that I have felt less confident. Alright, so it reads a little bit awkwardly so we can try to fix it. So there are a few situations in which I feel less confident and I think it's important to say it's speaking english, even though I asked you that question, but it's good to know that this is a topic that we're speaking about because if you just start saying there are a few situations in which I feel less confident, sometimes it's unclear what your where your lack of confidence is stemming from.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : Okay, so does that make sense?
ch_0 : <Yeah> I have one question in this comment
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <um> if I use the word in at the the last part of first sentence, so there are a few situations that I felt less confident in, is it correct?
ch_1 : <Yeah> that's also fine, we'll put that as well.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> So it's technically fine. <Um> I know that you said you didn't really want to talk about grammar, but I'll say that it's technically fine because it's like people say it like you will definitely get your point across by saying there are a few situations that I felt less confident in but
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : technically like grammatically speaking, it's not correct to end a sentence with a preposition like in and so that's why I said in which I feel less confident because that way this preposition in it's sort of like tucked into the middle of a sentence, but that being said, that's just like a tricky grammar rule, and it doesn't actually really matter when you're speaking. <Um> if you want to be like technical about it, then the second option is correct.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : But if you're just speaking with someone, nobody is going to look at you and be like what if you say in at the end of the sentence?
**ch_0 : Okay**
ch_1 : <Yeah> it's just something to take note of that. You're not supposed to end a sentence with a proposition, but when you're actually speaking it usually doesn't matter.
**ch_0 : I got it.**
ch_1 : <Yeah> I'm not here to be like your grammar teacher just to make you feel more confident in english and speaking
**ch_0 : <Huh> Gotcha.**
ch_1 : like the question, does that make sense?
**ch_0 : <Yeah> got it.**
ch_1 : Okay, so first when I have to talk about some topics which I do not have enough background or some cultures that I've never experienced in audiences I've ever met so far. Okay, <um> Alright, so first of all, this is very, very long. This is a very long thought
**ch_0 : <Ah>**
ch_1 : <um> which there's nothing wrong with it and I think that when we're speaking it's really easy to just keep a thought going and going because we don't see how long it is on paper, but I think that we should be a little bit cognizant about like transition words and doing stuff like that, so that we can make sentences a little bit more concise.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : Okay, so first when I have to talk about some topics which I do not have enough background or some cultures that I've never experienced in audiences who have never met. But I think these situations <um> in these situations it is really difficult to speak confidently because I cannot strongly share my <Yeah> okay, this is another point where your self corrected, which was awesome that I cannot share my opinion strongly because both of us have really different thoughts. Some first leap. <Mhm> So when I discussed some do not, firstly when I discuss some topics that I do not have enough background on or when I'm speaking with people from cultures that I'm unfamiliar with, <um> I think it can be really difficult to speak confidently. So you can say something like this is where we would break it up because I think this is like a natural transition in the idea. So in these situations, <um> those of us have <Mhm> Okay, so in these situations it can be tough for me to share my opinion strongly because we could have opposing views and then okay, also as I'm making corrections, if I say something and you're like, can we try it this way or I'm not sure I like that, we can always review it together in a way to make it sound better in a way that you would actually say because we want this to sound like the english that you want to use. Not the english that I use, which would be different.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Okay. So does that correction seem okay?
**ch_0 : <Yeah> Great.**
ch_1 : All right. And so this part I really like because it gives us a chance to use a new expression. So I also have to consider my opponent situation background circumstances. So there are so many variables which I give a speech so that so in that situation it became less confident. Alright, so have you ever heard of the phrase? Like put myself in someone else's shoes?
**ch_0 : <Uh> No,**
ch_1 : Okay this is a good one.
ch_0 : would you explain please
ch_1 : I put myself in someone else's shoes. It means have empathy. Okay, so putting yourself in someone else's shoes is a way for you to have empathy for someone in a situation while like taking into account their background, their circumstances. And so it would be like in this lesson right now, I have to put myself in your shoes and realize that it's a really vulnerable situation to be able to like speaking english to a stranger and open yourself up to like criticism. And so putting yourself in someone else's shoes is a way to like acknowledge someone's background, acknowledge the situation someone is in so that you can have a better, more like gentle outlook on the situation. And so it's something that people use a lot. So
**ch_0 : what?**
ch_1 : I also have to put myself in my opponents <mm> shoes. Because there are so many doctors, you can also say variables. That's fine. It's this is opponents plural. So opponents issues because there are so many variables in there lives which I am unaware of. All right. So I also have to put myself in my opponent's of shoes because there are so many variables in their lives which I am unaware of. And so when I give a speech in this situation, I become less confident.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Okay, so that's this answer. Okay, all this is good And we learned to put myself in someone else's shoes.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : Okay, awesome.**
**ch_0 : good.**
ch_1 : So in which specific situations do you feel less confident speaking in english? Like giving a speech or <um> talking to someone you've just met for the first time or talking about things that are more professional. <Um> what makes you nervous I guess.
ch_0 : <Um> <um> I I'm a little bit become became less confident when I give up <uh> formal speech because I don't have much experience in that that speech I only have a small chat with my friends but <uh> in my current situation I don't have any formal if I don't have much chance to participated in formal event and also when I talk with several friends then it is also makes me a little bit makes me less confident because when I talk each other like this just just two of us then I can easily follow <uh> the opponent's speaking but when I talked with like five or 6 people at once I have to follow those several people's speaking but it is not easy for me because I'm not that fluent right now. I think so <yeah> I think those two situations our makes me a little bit less confident.
ch_1 : Okay. Cut it. <Yeah> that makes a lot of sense. It's definitely difficult to speak in like a formal context and also to talk to a lot of different people at the same time because then things are just flying at you and you're not even sure who's saying them or who to respond to.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> OK. So one thing that I noticed is <um> when you say like opponent, <um> it has like the connotation like <um> when I hear it, I think that you're talking about like somebody that you're like against. Is that what you mean in this?
ch_0 : <Uh> no just just like this like I cannot imagine the exact words so <yeah>
ch_1 : Okay. <Yeah> <Yeah> So opponent is like someone that you're like against. <Um> And so <yeah> when you're say opponent it's like someone you're competing against or like
**ch_0 : <Ah>**
ch_1 : someone that you're fighting with and it's like <um> I'm not sure that that's what you intend to say.
ch_0 : I never intended that that meaning
ch_1 : Okay. <Yeah> See that's why we're here.
**ch_0 : which is**
ch_1 : <Um> All right. Let me see where you said opponent. <Oh> okay. So <yeah> so when I talk with several friends it makes me feel less confident because when I talk to each other like this just the two of us I can feel the opponent speaking easily. <Um> I have to follow them all speaking because alright so <yeah> talk with petrol friends I feel less confident then we can say dan because we're drawing a comparison right between talking with several friends versus like talking to someone one on one. So when I talked with several friends I feel less confident than when I am speaking with someone one on one need to follow. Okay. And then also so when you're saying when you want to say the word opponent <um> and you're not actually like fighting with someone or going against someone you have to think about their specific relationship to you. And so for like us or people that are like the same age ish it could you could call them like appear or like a friend. So
**ch_0 : <mhm>**
ch_1 : alternatives to opponents. <Um> here friend <um> if it's someone you work with, you could call them your colleague. <Um> So things like that that are just not <um> not like opponent. <Um> Not that you're like fighting with someone <um> opponent just has like a more negative connotation, opponent is like someone that you're like competing against or someone that you're at odds with.
**ch_0 : <Uh>**
ch_1 : So pierre friend colleague.
ch_0 : <um> I have one question here <uh> if I met someone like anonymously for example when I participated in party or networking session then I met many different People and at one and for the first time then how how can I, how can I say say them they are not my friends or they're not my colleagues right?
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Okay, I'm not sure that there's really a word for that, but I think you could just call them people, like you could just say
**ch_0 : <Ah>**
ch_1 : <um> I can follow the person speaking, so instead of saying I can follow the opponent speaking, you can say I can follow the person speaking. <Um> Then you could also say like you could specify where you met them. So like when I was talking to the person from the networking event,
**ch_0 : I see**
ch_1 : so when <yeah> sometimes when I'm not sure my relationship with someone, I just clarify like where I met them. <Um> So that way it's clear like what our relationship is because it's not like we're not friends, we're not peers, we're not coworkers. <Um> So it's <oh> when I was speaking to the person from the networking event we discussed X. Y. Z. <Um> and that way it's like it's clear what your relationship is and it seems like it's something that's formal, a little bit less familiar.
**ch_0 : <uh> <mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> It's not like you're saying <oh> when I spoke to my friend, we talked about this, okay. and so I <yeah> whenever I'm in doubt, I just I just say where I met them pretty much because then I can clarify, like if you say <oh> when I was talking to the person from the party, it makes it sound like it was a less formal situation, whereas if you're saying <oh> I met this person from the networking event
**ch_0 : I understand**
ch_1 : then it's very clear that like this interaction took place in a more professional context.
**ch_0 : Gotcha.**
ch_1 : Okay, okay, should we move on to the next question?
**ch_0 : <Yeah> sure.**
ch_1 : Okay, awesome. Okay, what are your english? Learning goals?
ch_0 : <Um> as I mentioned in my introduction speech, I want to I want to speak english <um> fluently so I can communicate it with native native native speakers without any problems and I can deliver my opinions and thoughts easily and I also I can also understand their ideas and thoughts and and <um> I want to express my feelings or or emotions in many different ways. Not only some limited words but also use variety of ways. So <uh> as a as a listener they they understand those those thoughts and feelings more more more more more naturally and easily and <yeah> that is by english learning goal.
ch_1 : Okay, awesome. Okay, so as I mentioned, okay, so your english, like the grammar part is really, really strong, like all of it is like totally understandable and it's the way that I would say it as well, which is really awesome to hear. <Um> but again some of the sentences are really long and they kind of go on and were saying like
**ch_0 : <ah>**
ch_1 : something, something and something, something and something something and and so they're very lengthy sentences and so right now we can work on just making them a little bit more concise and we can use some pauses or transition words <um> to help communicate that like we're taking little breaks in our sentences.
**ch_0 : okay**
ch_1 : Okay, so as I mentioned in my introduction speech, I want to speak english normally so that I can communicate it with a native, so I can communicate it with a native speaker without any problems and I can deliver my thoughts and opinions easily and I can understand their ideas and thoughts and I want to express feelings and emotions
ch_0 : there are too many and
ch_1 : just a little okay so why don't we work together and we can try to find some ways that we can
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : make it a little bit more concise. So where do you think some good breaking points are in these sentences and then we can try to figure out how to make it <um> more what we're trying to say but in fewer words.
ch_0 : <mm> <hmm> <um> after so we're without any problems I think we can split
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : long sentences there once.
ch_1 : <Yeah> Perfect. Okay so as I mentioned in my introduction speech I want to speak english fluently so I can communicate it with the native speaker without any problems. Perfect so also this is what you said is fine I just want to introduce you to something new. <Um> So I hope to be able to speak <yeah> so you can say I hope to be able to speak english fluently and so that's saying like your aspiration of it.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> so but what you said is also fine this is just different. <Um> So as I mentioned in my introduction speech I hope to be able to speak english fluently so I can communicate with a native speaker without any problems. Okay so I think this could be a sentence but let's let's try to use fewer words will make it more concise so <Mhm> So you could say I want to express my thoughts and opinions easily. <Um> So I can understand, okay could we work on maybe rephrasing this and we can try to make it a little bit more concise. We're using a lot of words because we say deliver my thoughts and opinions easily and then we save feelings and emotions in many ways. <Um> So we're kind of saying the same thing a couple of times and so we can try to make it
**ch_0 : <ah>**
**ch_1 : into one.**
**ch_0 : okay**
ch_1 : So we could say I want to express my thoughts, feelings and opinions easily with a the wide diverse vocabulary. So I want to express my thoughts feelings inconvenience easily with a wide diverse vocabulary. And then you could also say I don't want my vocabulary to be limiting dr and how I express myself. And so that's a really cool thing to say to like I don't want my vocabulary to be a limiting factor in how I express myself. And so that's basically saying that you want to be at that point in your english where you feel so confident that like your vocabulary is not limiting what you're able to say about thoughts, feelings and opinions? Okay does that sound good to you?
**ch_0 : <yeah> awesome,**
ch_1 : Okay so what are some steps that you can take towards achieving your goals?
**ch_0 : pardon?**
ch_1 : <Um> Just a follow up question. So what are some steps that you can take towards achieving your goals?
ch_0 : Okay <uh> <um> first <um> I have to make make more chances, more opportunities to speak in english like this Ringo and I tried to make many chances to speak in different background like like americans, british, Australians, Canadians and more so I have to I have to understand many different english, so do they use different english I guess so those <uh> those kind of experiences makes me makes my english more <uh> diverse and for full so <yeah> I think I think my my next step is try to make try to speak many different many different english english speakers. <Mm>
ch_1 : Okay that's great. <Yeah> that definitely helps a lot. Even I get confused sometimes when I hear a british person speak?
**ch_0 : <mhm>**
ch_1 : Okay, <yeah> they use a lot of different slang than we do? <Yeah>
**ch_0 : <yeah> that's right.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> Okay, this is just <um> this is barely even a correction. <Um> it's just another way to say things like, like you were saying earlier, you want to speak in more variety and so if you have like multiple different ways to say things, you can choose different ways to express the same concept and so that way your english can sound like it has a lot more variety, so
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : firstly I have to find more opportunities. Okay, so you could say I have to take more chances or you could say I have to find more opportunities and so both of them are correct but you wouldn't say I have to take more opportunities to speak english, that's like it's okay, it just sounds a little funky.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : Okay, so find more opportunities to speak in english then. Okay, now this part <um> those kinds of experiences make my english more diverse in full. So I think that my next step is trying to speak many different english, the whole sentence is fine except for the very, very last part, <um> many different english is not like a valid way to end the sentence and so we could say speak many different english dialects and so that way it's like <um> you're specifying what you actually mean and so like the Canadian dialect is different from the british dialect which is different from the american dialect.
**ch_0 : that's true. <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : Okay sound good,**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Okay should we move on to the last question
**ch_0 : no problem.**
ch_1 : but why do you think good communication skills are important?
ch_0 : <Mm> <um> good communication, good communication skills are really important because <mm> if you have good communication skills then many people, many people <uh> find find true value of your strong point and and you're you're you're good, good point. <Uh> so it helps you to, it helps you to get more opportunities in in in your your situation like school or company, but if you don't have good communication skills <uh> it can be disadvantaged to get good opportunities. So <uh> of course <um> if you if you don't have enough good communication skills you can do your job and you can study you can study well but <uh> if you try if you if you try your best then <uh> it is really helpful to improve your communication skills. No
ch_1 : Okay, awesome. <Yeah> communication skills are really important, especially like relationships, friendships, work setting everything, it's really essential. So good communication skills are really important because <yeah> okay, so why don't we try just to make, we can start adding in some varied vocabulary. So good communication skills are important because if you have good communication skills were saying the same thing, even though it's what the question asked, we can still like rephrase it, so good communication and then we can even bring in something new here, so good communication skills are essential because if you can communicate strongly will value your strong points. So good communication skills are essential because if you, if you can communicate strongly many people will value your okay, we use strongly twice in the same sentence and we don't want to do that. So can you think of any different way to express? <Um> if you can communicate strongly many people will value your something points or we could say something, opinions, something points, just a different word basically.
ch_0 : <mm> my my intention was <uh> what you are good at and what you can show and what you can do. Well I try to intend that things in in strong points but I cannot I cannot find exact words that I tried to speak. <Mhm>
ch_1 : Okay, no that's totally fair, so we could say
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> honestly you don't really need an adjective <um> just because what you're saying right here like you're saying already good communication skills are essential because if you can communicate strongly many people will value your points or many people, I like opinions better. So many people will value your opinions
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : because it's saying that the communication skills are really what's important here, you could also something that's a little bit more advanced come <um> compelling opinions. Have you ever heard the word compelling?
**ch_0 : <oh> no**
ch_1 : All right, so compelling is basically it's a word that means like strong. <Um> but it's more like convincing.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : So compelling is like
ch_0 : Like per se sieve?
ch_1 : bye, it's something that's like not able to be like argued against, it's something that's like so convincing, you're like <oh> this point was really compelling, this is what ultimately led me to believe. X. Y. Z.
**ch_0 : <Huh> <mhm>**
ch_1 : So <um> the folks stay strong opinion. <Um> you're very convincing, so evokes a strong opinion or it's like a very convincing point. So if you can communicate strongly many people will value your compelling opinions. <Mhm> <Yeah> so <yeah> compelling, it's a really good word to use. <Um> not able to be like refuted, you can't argue against it because it's so convincing. Okay, so okay, again we have some we have some long sentences here, so it helps you get more opportunities in your school or company, but if you don't have good communication skills, it can be a disadvantage to get good opportunities. So of course if you don't have good enough communication skills, you can do your job and study well.
**ch_0 : hm**
ch_1 : <Um> But if you try your best and it is really helpful to improve your communication skills. Okay, these are all really good points, let's work on how to make them a little bit more concise, so do you have any suggestions for like natural breaking points where we can break the sentence up
**ch_0 : <mhm>**
ch_1 : and also we don't like to start sentences with it just because this is like an ambiguous pronoun <um> And so I like to start it with what we're actually saying, So strong communication skills
ch_0 : <Um> I think we can split the sentences in After get good opportunities in the 2nd line. Does it make sense? Not sure.
ch_1 : <um> it does make sense, I think that we can I think that we can actually do it here, so it helps you, so strong communication skills help you to get more opportunities in your school or company. <Um> But if you don't have good communication skills. Wait okay <yeah> this is this is good. Okay so strong communication skills healthier to get more opportunities in your school or company, but if you don't have good communication skills they can be <um> a disadvantage to get good opportunities. <Um>
ch_0 : I think there are some duplicated sentences so we can concise them.
ch_1 : <Yeah> that's what I was just no no no no it's okay we're learning and this is tricky, you know it's like it's not easy to like have perfect english the first time that you're speaking, this is why we're practicing so strong communication skills help you to get more opportunities in your school and company. <Um> But if
ch_0 : It is my mistake. <Um>
ch_1 : why don't we say? But if you lack these skills thank you it can put you at a disadvantage.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : Okay and that way we're not saying opportunities a couple of times alright and now we can take this part. Hm Okay, so if you don't have good communication skills, you can do your job and study well, but if you try your best and it's really helpful to improve your communication skills. Okay, so for a week you can likely still do your job, perform in your job, okay? But then we could say, but studying and putting in effort can really help you improve your communication skills. Sorry, I don't know why it's weirdly formatted. Okay, but does this make sense? So if your communication skills are weak, you can likely performing your job, but studying and putting an effort can really help you improve your communication skills?
**ch_0 : Sounds great.**
ch_1 : Okay, so now we have two sentences and they're more concise than this paragraph here, and I think that they're saying what you're intending to say.
**ch_0 : That's right**
ch_1 : Okay, awesome. So I think that we are out of time, it looks like, but we did get through all the questions. And do you have any questions for me or things that you would like to do differently or just? <Yeah> any questions or comments.
ch_0 : I just I just want you to give me some overall feedback about today's lesson. It would be okay
ch_1 : Okay. <Yeah> so I would say that overall you're really your english is really, really strong. I think that the only things that you really need to improve on are just focusing on like what you actually want to say. <Um> and so this can be, it can be tough and like a conversational
**ch_0 : long sentences. <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> place, but if you like looked up questions like this, like the why do you think communication skills are important? And then you thought in your head before you spoke and you were like, what are the main points that I want to say? Or like you would, you could even write them down and say, what are the main things that I want to focus on that can help you kind of like make a more narrow point
**ch_0 : Right**
ch_1 : and not repeat things because you know exactly where you're going with an argument. And so I would say that you did use a few run on sentences and you did repeat things, but these are things that native english speakers are also guilty of and so it's not something that's like inherently wrong, it's just something that comes with being well spoken. And so I think that the more you practice and the more before you speak you're like this is actually what I want to say, then you'll be able to like have a more concise argument and you'll be able to speak with a lot more clarity, but I would say that overall your communication skills are very good.
ch_0 : okay thank you so much.
ch_1 : <Yeah> of course. Okay, hopefully this was helpful.
ch_0 : It was really helpful.
ch_1 : Okay, good. Alright, well it was nice to see you and I hope you have a nice night, I guess it's nighttime.
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm> Have a nice day. Right chill.
**ch_1 : Okay, bye.**
