 : 
ch_0 : recording in trouble. <Mhm>
ch_1 : Hi there, how are you today?
**ch_0 : I'm good thanks.**
ch_1 : Great to meet you. So my name is tally, I'm gonna be your cuter today <um> and I am a student from Emory University studying psychology <um> and I've been with Ringo now for about five months and I have some prior tutoring experience <um> tutoring people primarily who speak spanish into them to speak english, so have a little bit of prior experience <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and I'm so excited to meet you today, kim I'd love to hear a little bit about you and your goals for the lesson today.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> And my name is kim and I am freshman in my university and currently I'm having a get here and maybe next month I will go back to my school and continue studying. So I'm doing my job here. I the various part time jobs and also some few personal projects like unloading a youtube video or the taking picture projects and also I
**ch_1 : Well**
ch_0 : <um> that are traveling maybe later,
**ch_1 : <yeah>**
ch_0 : Happy to meet you.
ch_1 : awesome, well that's super fun. That all sounds amazing. <Um> so I see for today that you are looking for a discussion focused lesson <um> and with that, would you like me to kind of reserve my feedback for the last few minutes of class
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : or I can Okay, great, I'll do that. <Um> and then I see that you've kind of highlighted that I look at vocabulary grammar, pronunciation fluency. Is there anything specific that you want to work on with those or just kind of broadly all of them?
ch_0 : <Mhm> No, I'm good.
ch_1 : Okay, good. So that sounds great. We can jump right into some of these questions then that you've highlighted. <Um> so today we read this really interesting article just about kind of looking back on on college and, and older times and thinking about self reflection and so <um> I guess the first question that I would like to ask would be, what are your own strengths and weaknesses?
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Oh> and I <um> have little time to preparing for today's class because I got a little a so I'm so sorry, but I hope you understand but
ch_1 : <Oh> no worries at all. That is completely fine.
ch_0 : <oh> thank you. And <um> I think my strength is I'm pretty good at planning and or so I think I don't hesitate to express my emotions too. My people pool, especially the emotions like love Joyful. Right? And I think this is good and there's two and then my weaknesses I think is I'm leader in pursuit, making choices. And so sometimes I unconsciously said, <uh> I like her relationship with my lovers friends. Even my, with my friend in my family's I sometimes say strong or strict two them. So I hope I <mm> <hmm> fix my bad habits like <Yeah>
ch_1 : Those are great to have that introspection is another word for self reflection that we would say. <Um> I think that's that's great that you have that ability to see that in yourself. You know <um>
**ch_0 : thank you.**
ch_1 : a lot of people don't have that ability to see anything wrong with themselves or even name a weakness or even a strength, but I think you've really put them end towards quite well just <um> this ability to express emotions to others. And <um> sometimes you would call that just informally opening up and sharing.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> and I'm sure that's really helpful when you're you know making new friends and I'm sure it helps to get close to people really fast. So
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> that's awesome and that in terms of your weaknesses, I think you know everybody has those those downfalls about themselves. <Um> but I'd love to hear maybe <um> any ideas that you have for maybe changing your weaknesses or do you even want to change them? Do you think it makes you who you are?
ch_0 : <Mm> <Mhm> So you asked me to, you want to change? <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Yeah> I can repeat it. So so my question is do you want to change your weaknesses?
**ch_0 : Yes. <Mm>**
ch_1 : <Um> and then if so how would you change
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Um> I want to change my weaknesses. I want to fix the bad habit, especially to stay strong or street to my friends course. That's quite unfair because there are in my, they are with me you know horizon two relationship
**ch_1 : horizontal? <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_0 : I say I act like I kind of a teacher, two of them.
ch_1 : Almost <yeah> almost. So I I think what I get you saying is that it's almost like a hierarchical like <yeah> relationship but it is you want it to be horizontal so that <yeah> that makes sense, continue on. <Yeah>
ch_0 : No. Okay, alright and that would be the obstacle to get more inward deep relationship with them so I want to fix it like just I want to be good advisor to them but not a teacher or their parents think so <yeah> I want to, I hope to try to fix it.
ch_1 : that's <yeah> I think that's that's a great idea, you know I asked
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : that question because a lot of times weaknesses even though
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : not not the best also are still who we are, so you never want to change everything about yourself
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : and so that's kind of why I was asking, but I definitely understand that wanting to create
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : less of a teaching relationship, more of a horizontal relationship like you, so <um> put it so well and so I think <um> I agree with you on that personally, I could definitely benefit from taking a little bit of that as well, I'm always, I think I'm always teaching people a little too,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : so <um> that's definitely we have similar weaknesses there
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> but awesome, okay, so that was super interesting to hear, I think the next question I'm gonna ask you about was <um> let's see, so what was the most fulfilling moment in your life up to this point,
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <Yeah> <Ah> this happened last last week and
**ch_1 : wow.**
ch_0 : <um> I I did <mm> onto on personal teaching with high school students <um> until last week but this is very different from <um> others classes because their parents and their teachers, she was in the high school where I appreciated so her teacher contact me too help her to graduate and help her to beat in the class and get relationship with their friends and then I didn't teach her study study or other things. I just meet her and heard her stories, heard her days, heard her buildings but at first I was a little tired to hear her stories and I think it's literally useless to me. I thought that time so <um> and I think she will she Gutfeld that so at the first time the beginning with her it's not quite good
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but after I travels for a while and also I meet some new people and having good relationship I learned that <um> the importance of the person who here who here your story your stories. So after that I tried to be more warm and anymore content to her and then I stole her
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : I still she start change and last week she said to me that she wants to study, she wants to start study again and she started
**ch_1 : At**
ch_0 : she <um> thirst how to go to university on herself. So I was happy to hear that there was still most
ch_1 : <yeah> wow, that's incredible that you got to be a part of that and also that you had such a big part of that, I mean you know you had such a big influence over her life there, you know?
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Um> so wow, that's that is definitely a fulfilling moment, I'm sure you are so so happy and just
**ch_0 : Thank you <mm>**
ch_1 : I guess glad that you kind of stuck it out with her, even though it wasn't great at first, like you said, it kind of became this really important thing for both of you <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : so that's <yeah> that's very very cool, I I love that <um> I definitely I also love that you could come up with that so so quickly and it's kind of right there because I couldn't think of just one fulfilling moment, you know? So
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> I think that's great and I love to hear, let's see and on the opposite end of that, I would love to hear maybe a time where you wish you had <um> maybe better self reflection, so a time where maybe you made a mistake or you were having difficulties, an unfulfilling moment where you wish you would have this type of self reflection.
ch_0 : <Um> I think I didn't understand what you asked. So can you?
ch_1 : <Oh> I can say <yeah> I can say it again, of course, no worries. So my question is now that you've told me this really great fulfilling memory,
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_1 : is there an the opposite of that, is there an unfulfilling memory that you have <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm> hm**
ch_1 : that you could tell me a little bit about? Just, just share
**ch_0 : <mm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : that make a little bit more sense?
ch_0 : <Um> I worked at the gym
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : jim information task so I have And I work with one trainer thanks at first he was very kind and I thought he is a good person first <um> but before I getting to know him he was very un responsible too his own work and he
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : he was <um> leader one kind of people unkind to the team members. So I most of person who had to fix the problem she made or the time
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
ch_0 : and then so the time I working with him most of <um> worst memories that I had while doing part time jobs and he finally and he finally lied to the members and me then he has kind of sickness and he had to go back to his I'm home but there was light because I met him in the on the street and that that is not that is the last memory with him. So that was bad.
ch_1 : <yeah> that sounds like a terrible, terrible memory kind of
**ch_0 : <Mhm> All right.**
ch_1 : the complete opposite of what you just told me and you know it seems like he has a lot of this, he's lacking a lot of the self reflection that we're talking about here.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Um> So <yeah> wow, I can only imagine that that was a very unfulfilling moment. <Um> and I'm sure you're glad that you're not working with him anymore
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : but you know at least you know that it wasn't just <um> you that he was doing this to but other people as well because <um> I don't know, it's always better to have somebody to relate to
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> but super interesting, so I think then we'll move on to this <um> this next
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : interesting question which is about your job or your dream job. So <um> the question is ignoring all practical limitations, what is your dream job and why?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> <Um> when I was in high school <um> I quite worried about global warming and the future or she meant and so I sometimes said to my friends and teachers and I want to be happy grandmother who give cookies and tell some good stories to the Children in the town. But I'm afraid that I would not have the chance because but time maybe human would not eat it if the global roaming gets thing worse and still now I think that global warming is too big issue too us so ignoring our particular mutations, I hope to be the maybe <um> the leader of science scientists group, blower scientist group and try to fix the
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : probably the basic problems or the environment and hello and make it possible to be our generation to be the senior generation. <Mhm>
ch_1 : <yeah> that makes sense,
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : that that makes a lot of sense. <Um> and I think that's amazing dream to have and especially <um>
**ch_0 : Yes,**
ch_1 : already, you know, I know a lot of my friends
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : in college, I have no idea what they're what their passion is or what they want to do with their lives and they don't have that overall kind of, I mean goal driving them and so I think <um> it's amazing that you have this and it seems like
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : you know you're one of those people that the article is talking about that has a lot of self reflection,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : which I think is such a wonderful thing to have. So
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : definitely. <Um> and then I love hearing about your dream job, so I so you're kind of hoping to be maybe some sort of scientist environmentalist another word half where in America <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and so I you know, you said you're going into college soon, Are you hoping to study more of this in school or
**ch_0 : What?**
ch_1 : I don't know how it works there but in America we have something called like a major where you can <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : do you have that there? You could tell me a little bit about maybe your school, what you hope to study?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> <Um> My colleagues major is emblematic engineering
**ch_1 : <Oh> wow.**
ch_0 : but I don't know much about my major because I'm had to get beer
**ch_1 : Right.**
ch_0 : right after my first semester ended. So I plan to study more about my major and then if I felt some like I maybe I could so the of broad maybe.
**ch_1 : <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_0 : Yes. No, so I'm just thinking about this.
**ch_1 : that's**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : very interesting. I know a lot of people <um> at least in America and I'm I'm sure in in Korea, well are you in japan right now or Korea
**ch_0 : No in Korea.**
ch_1 : Korea? Okay. <Um> so then I'm sure that you have <um> really, really, I guess good opportunities to study abroad, you know in the States were not
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : too far <um> and even europe, you kind of have the whole world open to you. So
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> I have a few friends actually who <um> are in environmental sciences is what we call it <um> and they're doing a summer program I think in
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : western europe right now and so <um> very interesting. But <yeah> there's a lot that you can do
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : because as you said right now there were at a kind of a crisis with the environment and so
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : you know, we really need anyone, anyone who wants to help should help. I definitely agree with that. So <um> that's awesome and I'm so kind of hearing that that's your dream job, what you hope to do <um> if you could study abroad anywhere, where would you want to study or travel to? I'd love to hear that as well.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm> <Oh> I hope to study at states and
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : and also I pieces Denmark
**ch_1 : <Oh> yes,**
ch_0 : last and I, so the country is <mm> Very, very good.
**ch_1 : <yeah>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : that is**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : so fun. So <yeah> Denmark, I've never been there, I've never left the States. I'm from <um> Alabama which is <um> kind of near florida very like very southern United States and so it's very hot here. <Um>
ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm> <Yeah> <Mhm>
ch_1 : but <yeah> super, it's super hot, it was 100 degrees today. So
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Oh>**
ch_1 : <um> <yeah> <yeah> so <um> very warm. But <um> I would love to visit Denmark and I would also love to visit California, which I don't know if you've ever been to California, it's probably actually closer to you than it is to me. <Um> But <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : California is beautiful and I definitely recommend if you ever study abroad in the States
**ch_0 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : to come visit because I have just seen pictures and I think it's
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : the most beautiful place ever. I mean it has the ocean, the mountains, everything. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : But <yeah> that sounds amazing. So hoping to maybe study abroad in the States <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : awesome. So I'd love to kind of, let's see maybe I would end on, I like this question here which is just <um> I'd love to hear and you've already told me a bit about this, but what are your likes and dislikes.
ch_0 : <mm> My likes and dislikes <um> <mm> <Um> I think I like two discuss and having a minimum for time with friends. <Mhm> I dislike when people. <Mm> <Oh> boy. Thing two reply
**ch_1 : Yes,**
ch_0 : and <mhm> Not all the time because I understand some and even me even I sometimes come the introvert sometimes. So I totally understand. But when I see people that they are being later unopened and avoiding socializing. We good people that have good purpose to meet them. <Mhm> I think that is the waste of there time and their energy to you. Make that uncomfortable feelings between people. So. <Mm> <Yeah> I think. <Mhm>
ch_1 : that makes a ton of sense. <Um> and I get what you're saying there and that you know well first of all your likes having a meaningful time with friends. I love that. I think it's so important to just have time to talk with your friends and and discuss, I think you know, a lot of time today, it's I'm just kind of looking at your phones together and just kind of sitting there and not really talking, but it's so important to have those conversations still. <Um> so I love that and
**ch_0 : <mm> Right.**
ch_1 : in terms of your dislikes, I also agree in that, you know, you what you're saying is you know, you understand when people are quiet or introverted, but it's when people become what we like to call like standoffish or <um> unlike unopened is kind of another word that you used for, but we would call standoff ish and that they're just really almost rudely not interested. <Yeah> not interested in talking with you and <um> and I just like that too because
ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm> <mm> <hmm>
ch_1 : you know, I think it's it's important especially with everything going on in the world that you make human connections and that
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : you know, we show that we are there for each other and we support each other. So
**ch_0 : <mm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <um> definitely agree with those likes and dislikes that you have. <Um> And one final question I'd like to kind of follow up and ask is do your friends have share similar likes and dislikes to you or are they different? Like the term opposites attract?
ch_0 : <Mhm> And some are some dollars. Some good and some others don't.
**ch_1 : <Uh> <huh>**
ch_0 : <Um> few friends still connected. Say it with me and always during our daily lives with them for some friends are not that friendly, especially in, but when we finally meet them again, they reach like hang like just high school keys. <Hmm> <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Yeah> that's it's nice to have a good mixture. I think that's really nice and I could say the same about my friends. I have a few that are very similar to me and then I have others that
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : are very different and sometimes I wonder how we're even friends but
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : it just works out and so I totally get that. <Um> So awesome. <Um> So if it's alright with you I might use these last 10 minutes to just go over some corrections and overall notes.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> Thank you.
ch_1 : Okay, awesome. So overall <um> I think you did a really great job today, you said you know that you didn't have time to prepare but <um> I thought you did really really well. <Um>
**ch_0 : Thank you.**
ch_1 : so do not worry about that at all. <Um> And I think that you have <um> you're very what we would call articulate, so you're good at putting your thoughts into words and <um> so I'm gonna that's a very positive part of fluency so <um> that is definitely a gift and I think even at times when
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : the wording was a little awkward, I was able to really understand you and so <um> super nice, I'm gonna change just a little bit of wording through paraphrase in a minute but
**ch_0 : Great.**
ch_1 : <um> I'm gonna just no minor awkward phrases <um>
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : in terms of vocabulary, I did not notice <um> really any major issues so
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> there was you know a few times that I would correct your wording a little bit but most of the time you did a great job, so again that was minor <um> grammar was very very minor, I heard one or two instances where your verb tense was wrong but
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> it was just present rather than past, is what the two were. <Um> But they were very small and I think it was just because you were kind of going a little bit faster but yes, a super minor in terms of pronunciation, just a few notes. So <um> R and L sounds so I know in korean that ra and la
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : are the same same kind of sound and so it's very difficult. So there was a few times where I just kind of heard them mix and so
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : one kind of helpful hint that I like to give is for ra the r sound you just kind of right? So almost put your lips right
**ch_0 : Right. <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : <um> versus with la the L sound, you put your tongue behind your top two teeth. So La.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> La**
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : right.**
ch_1 : <Yeah> exactly. So <um> I always like to make so that's kind of the difference putting your tongue behind behind the top teeth for the L sound. And then one other sound that I wanted to mention was the I sound
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : specifically for certain vowels, so
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : just making sure you did hit that sound, but it was very quick sometimes and so I would make sure to just really really enunciate that one. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Bye. <Yeah> so those were just kind of overall notes and <um> well first you have any questions with that.
ch_0 : <mm> <Um> I <um> didn't understand that. I ate sounds but
ch_1 : <Yeah> so <um> I can give a good example would be the word little <um> so that has that
**ch_0 : <mhm>**
**ch_1 : <um>**
**ch_0 : <Ah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and so just making sure that you really hit that sound versus just going little little.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : Really? <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : <Um>**
ch_1 : Does that make a little bit more sense there?
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Okay good, I'll put that as an example example. <Um> Little so just a small, it's small but there were just a few times I heard it and so I thought I would make note but <um> otherwise great work. And do you have any more questions about that overall <um> feedback?
ch_0 : <Mhm> No, I'm good thanks.
**ch_1 : Okay great. So**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <um> I'm gonna go ahead and paraphrase just a little bit of it. <Uh> Let's see, I'm thinking maybe let's paraphrase, I might paraphrase actually towards the end. <Um> So what I'm gonna say is <um> on our last question where we were talking about likes and dislikes, so I'm gonna paraphrase <um> this portion the beginning. <Um> So one thing that I, one reason why I chose this one is first of all, I really liked your topic sentence and I think continuing to include a topic sentence for every answer is really important. <Um> So you know by almost including the words of the question in that first sentence is something that <um> I do with every question I answer
**ch_0 : You**
ch_1 : and it just really helps the listener understand and so you did that here and I really liked that, so I'm gonna keep that portion, so I'm going to say <um> maybe my <um> one of my primary primary likes
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : <um> is <um> having having a meaningful or maybe a deep and meaningful, deep and meaningful discussion.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Okay my friends, so here I got rid of that extra <um> I like to discuss having a meaningful time. So this we didn't need to just talk about discussing
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : that. So it almost referred to I'm talking about talking about having a good time, if that makes sense. So we really didn't need that almost double wording.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So here I've changed that. <Um> And then I went ahead and just ended the sentence there because I really want to emphasize that this is your like and then you know, you went in for a little bit longer about your dislikes, which is fine, but I still want to highlight, okay, this is my like before just jumping into a whole new topic in the senate. So
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : <um> and then I'm really gonna separate it by this transition phrase. <Um>
**ch_0 : Right.**
ch_1 : On the other hand, <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : maybe one of my, maybe one of my strongest
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : dislikes is when people or is when people. And then so here I'm going to summarize what you said a little bit, because there was just a little bit of repetition is when people are is when people are <um> standoffish is kind of what is that freight. So stand off Ish is that this is a very kind of <um>
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <oh> I guess it does, let's see, I'm gonna see if it it's a very <um> idiomatic kind of native english speaking thing to say. so I wasn't sure if it was going to correct it or not, but I just put quotes there is when people are standoffish <um> and do not open up
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : to me and <yeah> and do not open up to me. <Um> I understand <um> the need at times to be <um> quiet or an introvert
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> but I dislike when people are rude
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : and so so here <um> there was kind of a little bit of repetition that I thought we could get rid of <um> and I did kind of I'm gonna go ahead and add in some of it, so I kind of summarize the rest of your paragraph a little bit <um> and just said like I and avoiding socializing with good people with good purpose that was so I understood what you were saying but it was just not completely fluent and we could say that in a lot fewer words and so <um>
**ch_0 : Well.**
ch_1 : I I think we kind of the words stand offish and not opening up that all kind of encompasses that. <Um> and that I liked including the, I understand at times <um> then at times I understand the need at times to be quite quiet, let's see, go ahead or an introvert, but I dislike when people are rude <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : that automatically implies that they're being rude by being quiet and <um> making you use the word or the phrase uncomfortable feelings which is just a little bit unnatural, so I change that. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : But does this paraphrase make sense to you?
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : Okay awesome so**
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : I'm gonna do one more shorter paraphrase,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : let's see <um> maybe <um> I'm gonna do this one when we're talking about high school, so in your dream job,
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : so I'm gonna say <um> back and I hear I did actually kind of like <um> how you did not include the question in your topic sentence, so you kind of went back and the way you included when I was in high school, I liked that kind of transition to show okay we're talking about the past and it's going to lead to the future, it's going to be like a story.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> So to further emphasize that I'm going to put the word back
**ch_0 : The.**
ch_1 : <um> just to really kind of emphasize this past story
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : back when I was in high school. <Um> Maybe I first started <um> started maybe worrying. We can also say ruminating is another word for worrying, Ruminating, just kind of a fancier word. <Um> I started worrying ruminating about the issue of global warming. So <um> I what I changed here was I kind of made it one sentence and then I also got rid of this <um> I quite worried about global warming and
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : I changed it to, I first started worrying
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : to better express that this wasn't a past worry of yours, it's it's still a worry
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> that you're still worried about it. Just started back then
**ch_0 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : <um> So yes, and then <um> so I first started worrying about the issue of global warming's <um> specifically, <um> I began to think about the future of humanity <um> and as a result, maybe began to, or maybe as a result, <um> maybe reached for the goal or as a result <um> formed, formed the goal,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : formed the goal to the goal to become a happy grandmother.
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : And then <um> you went after that into a little bit more about, you know what that entails, and I thought that was all great. <Um> but here I just <um> made it sound a little bit more natural, I changed the word order a little bit and <yeah> also change the future of humans to the future of humanity, <um> just because that's usually how we say it, the common phrase, we just usually say future of humanity, but does this all make sense? Does this change, makes sense?
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : Okay, awesome. So I think that's all for today, I will include some more paraphrases in your feedback report and it was great meeting you.
ch_0 : <Yeah> Thank you. Thank you so much.
**ch_1 : Thanks, bye kim**
