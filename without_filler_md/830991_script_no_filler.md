**ch_0 : <Mm> <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> Is there anything else I should know? Or do you have any other requests before we get started?
ch_0 : Okay. <Ah> a place to be a person like a friend. <Yeah> that's all.
ch_1 : <Mhm> Okay. <Yeah> sounds good.
**ch_0 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : We can start with question one then. So why did you choose this topic for today's class discussion?
ch_0 : <Uh> as you know, I'm a businessman and then I'm the order of
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : espresso bar. So that's why I wondered what kind of marketing strategy
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : the readable company used.
ch_1 : <Yeah> definitely, since you're like into business, it'd be interesting to find out. But after reading the article and hearing about their marketing strategy, what did you think about it?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <Yeah> <Yeah> after leading the article you can talk more. <Yeah> <Uh> Okay. Now I understood that your remaining.
**ch_1 : <Um> <mm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So <yeah> actually their marketing strategy was very amazing.
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> they have sword, sword just coffee and drinks
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : before readable. There are many many of and coffee drinks but
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : the research are totally different. <Mm>
ch_1 : <Yeah> definitely. Red Bulls are very different from like coffee or tea. So it kind of
**ch_0 : Okay**
ch_1 : changed the way people might think about caffeinated drinks since there wasn't much of a energy drink market before Red bull.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Um> Do you prefer drinking coffee or do you like drinking energy drinks?
ch_0 : <Mhm> I totally I'm a coffee man. And then <yeah>
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : as I told you I'm an owner of the as first bar the coffee shop.
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : So I'm a coffee lover. So <yeah> I prefer I'm free I'm free for the coffee.
**ch_1 : <Ah>**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : do you have a favorite kind of coffee that you like?
ch_0 : <Yeah> I used to love the hand the poor of coffee before but nowadays
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <um> fall in love with espresso
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : with a little bit of the sugar. I need a little bit of sugar on it.
ch_1 : <mm> <hmm> <Yeah> definitely. <Um> when you drink coffee, do you drink it for the taste or do you drink it for the caffeine and help wake yourself up in the morning?
ch_0 : <Ah> Both of it.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So every <yeah> I have a daily routine after opening my store. So
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <um> I proved I extract
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : four cups of four cops over Espresso
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and then I taste it and then I feel the coffee
**ch_1 : Again.**
ch_0 : to wake up perfectly.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Um> So do you feel like it's pretty much like an instant, like just within a few minutes you can feel woken up or does it take a little bit longer? Like maybe an hour to feel the effects of the coffee?
ch_0 : No I did not understand, I didn't understand what we're talking about.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> so when you drink coffee,
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : how long did it take you until you feel more awake
**ch_0 : Here.**
ch_1 : or that you feel the effect of the coffee?
ch_0 : Okay I understand around 10 minutes.
ch_1 : <Oh> wow, pretty fast.
ch_0 : <Mhm> brief it. So <uh>
**ch_1 : <Uh>**
ch_0 : usually <uh> americans they prefer the americano were
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : brew coffee Or <yeah> two days coffee from Starbucks. So the thing is the mix up with a little bit of the coffee and the water
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but the espresso is a very teeny tiny beverage so too many coffee <um> including the <um> one of us who are very similar but the leader so
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : then next me wake up very fastly.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah> I don't really drink coffee like at all because I don't really like the taste
**ch_0 : Right. <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and then so I don't really know much about coffee, but then also I didn't want to drink caffeine and become like, <oh> I need caffeine to wake up in the morning.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> Yes <mm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> but it always smells good when I walk into a coffee shop, but I don't really like to taste a little bit too bigger for me.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> <Mhm> So I have a concussion to you,
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : so when you go to Starbucks or other coffee shop, what kind of beverage do you pick?
ch_1 : <Ah> Normally I don't really go to the coffee shop since I don't like coffee, but I do,
**ch_0 : <Uh> Really?**
ch_1 : <yeah> if I do because me and my friends want to go there
ch_0 : <Uh> <huh> <Mhm> <Yeah>
ch_1 : order like tea or any like the other drinks, like juices, like the pink drinks from like Starbucks.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : But I try not to get Starbucks as much because it's a full of sugar, so it's not really good for you.
**ch_0 : <Uh> <mm>**
ch_1 : But <um> they always look I like the look of coffee. It's very pretty. It's all mixed in with the cream and the milk and things. But
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Uh> I have one more question to you so you are not a copy person but <uh> to take a
ch_1 : <yeah> <Mhm> <Yeah> I'm not a coffee person.
ch_0 : conversation with your friends, you go to some
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <uh> t store or other place
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : places you can sit down and for taking a conversation with your cruise or friends.
**ch_1 : <mm> <Hmm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So where do you prefer to go?
ch_1 : <Mhm> I really like,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : even though I said
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : I don't like Starbucks, I have a lot of sugar,
**ch_0 : <Huh> <Uh>**
ch_1 : I like to go to the boba, even though that has a lot of sugar but I think since it tastes better to me it's worth it.
ch_0 : Okay. <Mhm> <Uh> <huh> <Yeah> <Uh> <huh>
ch_1 : But <yeah> I like going to like a bobo shop or just go to like a restaurant to eat some food.
ch_0 : <Oh> boy shop <mm> Okay I see.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> and then just <um> a couple of corrections you would say their marketing strategy was very amazing. So here
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> it sounds, I think it's a little bit awkward to say very amazing but a very <um> common word when describing marketing strategies is genius. So the marketing strategy was genius.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> To look. <Ah> <hmm>
ch_1 : <Um> That sounds a little bit a little bit more formal rather than amazing.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> true.**
ch_1 : <Um> And then you said before Rambo there are not and he said not many cough caffeine drinks but the results are totally different. So when you say the results are totally different, just mean it affects you a lot differently than the current
**ch_0 : Okay. <Mhm> hm.**
ch_1 : caffeinated drinks that were on the market previously.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <Mhm> <Mhm>
ch_1 : So I guess just like what did you mean by the results were totally different.
ch_0 : <Ah> The richard, I mean before readable there are many companies so
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : I have a one example in South Korea.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So there is one company, the name is the podcast. The thing also <yeah> coughing beverage
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but when I think about when I compare podcast and the readable <uh> the result the money they can take <uh> <uh>
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : the money <uh> that the company making the companies are Ernie
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : the money amount of the money is totally different when they compare to company Red Bull and then the korean company's cost even though they're the tasters are similar
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
ch_0 : and then <uh> they're <uh> they are sailing same topic of beverage. That thing is a coffee and drink. But
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : <yeah> june <ah> <yeah> is it making sense?
ch_1 : Yes. So you're saying that before Rebel, other energy drinks didn't do as well, but Rebel was a great success compared to other
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : caffeine drinks. Is that what you're saying?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mm> Yes and then before Red Bull entered in Korea the podcast was the number one company
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : we're sailing coffee and drink in south Korea in my country
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : for a long time but after rentable entered my country the number is to change it rideable and then
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : master and then blah blah and the
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : I see so you could say like before Red Bull there were other energy drink companies
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : but Red Bull was much more successful than the <um> other companies.
**ch_0 : <mm> Okay**
ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah> and then you had also said that the taste I taste the coffee. To wake up perfectly.
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : So it's just a little bit awkward to say
**ch_0 : <mm> Right <mm>**
ch_1 : wake up perfectly. So we can just say
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I like to start off my day with coffee.
ch_0 : <mm> <hmm> let's just start off my day was coffee. <Mhm>
ch_1 : <Mm> I could say coffee helps me wake up
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : in the morning.**
ch_0 : I have a question about <uh> the first paragraph
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : so intense**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : so in order to make a sense when I say I'd like to start <uh> with the coffee <uh> hold a second I'd like to start I'd like to start
**ch_1 : <hmm> No problem.**
ch_0 : my day with coffee without off.
ch_1 : <Yeah> you could say I like to start my day with coffee. That's also perfectly fine,
ch_0 : <Mhm> Okay thank you that.
ch_1 : awesome. <Yeah> Good question. <Um> and then he said the coffee including one ounce. So makes me wake up very fastly so fastly isn't a word. So we can't say fastly
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and also to make this sentence a little bit more clear your message rather than just saying the coffee is small. Or just only one ounce. We can say
**ch_0 : <mm> <hmm>**
**ch_1 : <uh>**
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
ch_1 : Since the coffee or since the espresso.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : It's only one ounce.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : It is very concentrated. Or you say the caffeine is very concentrated.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : The caffeine is very content
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : concentrated. So it makes me wake up very quickly so quickly rather than vastly.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : <Um> And then you said for taking conversation with your friends. You can't really take conversation but you can say
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : to catch up with your friends or to make conversation with your friends.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : Catch up with your friends or to make conversation with your friends.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : <Yeah> Any questions.**
ch_0 : <Uh> I don't have more.
**ch_1 : Okay, awesome.**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Uh> moving on to question two, what did you learn from this article?
ch_0 : <mm> <Ah> the genius marketing strategy from
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : rideable.**
ch_1 : And what did you think about their marketing strategy or why you think it's so genius?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <mm> <Uh> they having made good <uh> good story lines with just the only energy drink. <Mhm> So the topic the energy drink is very simple and manual people <yeah> think about this <uh> when you give readable the company the topic to many, many people and then I think there are only minority people think about this kind of story line. So because of that I think the readable had and then have the genius a marketing strategy. <Mhm>
ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm> And when you say a minority of people think about this kind of storyline,
**ch_0 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : what do you mean by that? Do you mean that not many people knew what rebel was or not many people knew about energy drinks back then.
ch_0 : <mm> <Yeah> <Um> Hold a second. <Yeah> I think many people like <mhm> Ordinary people
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : when I ask about coffee and drink they just think about coffee and drink is just coffee and drink.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Oh> <mm> <hmm>
ch_0 : But the reservoir company and then the monster company,
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : their competitor even though the simple topic they put a lot of story lines and the marketing thing and then
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : with just a simple beverage they from this from the simple beverage, simple thing
**ch_1 : Taking.**
ch_0 : they married the people for love.
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : They made the people they made people <uh> to buy the product. Okay.
**ch_1 : I see.**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> that makes sense. So they associated rebel with many other sports or different ideas
**ch_0 : <mm> <hmm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : even though just the energy drink itself is simple, they connected to things like extreme sports or being more productive.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> Yes. So
**ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <um> <yeah> the thing is not easy. So when you drink coffee and drink you can imagine about extreme extreme sports.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : They totally connected. They have connected the beverage with sports. The thing is amazing.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <mm> <hmm> definitely. <Um> I think that's a great marketing strategy to expand their market because maybe a lot of people wouldn't drink energy drinks or like you said, they did mostly just think of coffee when it comes to caffeine beverages. So this way they can expand their market by associating their brand with multiple different activities.
ch_0 : <Mhm> I have a okay. Yes you really you like and then when they, when people buy their product they feel <uh> the value on it.
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : definitely can help them
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : associate their brand with many different parts of their life.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> but in terms of a couple of corrections, you had said they have made good storylines with just only energy drinks.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> So here it's a little awkward to say storylines, it doesn't really fit here because storylines is more involved when talking about a plot of a movie or like a tv show the story in there. So here we can say
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm> <huh>**
ch_1 : <um> they <um> made a good, you could just say like marketing campaign
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : with with only energy drinks <um> He said the topic of energy drink is very simple. So here again topic it's more having to do with like themes in the book or in a movie or a tv show or like article but since we're talking about energy drinks you could say Yukon
**ch_0 : <mm> <mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : except of energy drinks is very simple.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : So concept more just like the idea of them and like their purpose <um> and then you had said when you give Rebel the topic too many people there are only a minority of people who think about this kind of storyline. So here you can't really like give the topic to people but you can say when you introduced rebel to the public,
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : when you introduce red to the public there are only a minority of people who and when you say think of this kind of storyline just mean are reminded of sports or what do you mean by think about the storyline?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm> <Uh> This is harder to explain but it deserves
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : serious harder to answer actually
ch_1 : <Ah> So I guess are you saying when Rebel was first introduced to the public? Since there's not much of a market for energy drinks or since not many people knew what energy drinks were at the time? Not many, not many people thought of like I guess when people throw the caffeine they didn't think of energy drinks they got a coffee. Is that what you mean?
ch_0 : <mm> <Uh> Actually I don't understand you perfectly.
ch_1 : <Oh> <yeah> so <um> when you say people, not many people thought of this storyline
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : did you mean when people think of caffeinated beverages, the first beverage that they are reminded of is coffee rather than energy drinks.
ch_0 : <Oh> I mean <uh> <Uh> <huh> in my humble opinion <uh> there are in my <uh> in my business area there are few standards men
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <mhm>**
ch_0 : even though they are selling the same product.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : Okay some good keeps cave the value with the product product and the value together to customers but some bad bad or no more salesman's are they just sell only product without value?
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : So I wanted to talk about this thing to you.
ch_1 : I see. So maybe people just sell the energy drink itself and say, <oh> it gives you energy,
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_1 : but Rebel did something different by associating energy drinks with sports or productivity.
ch_0 : Yes you're right. So <uh> so I mean when you give in the public and
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : make them sell it,
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : ordinary people just sell
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : just beverage. But the reliable company were good salesman, they sell
**ch_1 : <Oh> I see.**
ch_0 : product with the value. <Mhm> So.
ch_1 : Okay, so people refers to the companies rather than like the public person who's buying it?
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : I see. Okay, <yeah> so we can say when Rebel was introduced to the public, there's a minority of other
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : ener energy drink companies,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : companies that were and selling
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : or or that we're associating there, there verges with
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : set with something I guess we'll just stay with productivity and
**ch_0 : dr**
**ch_1 : all right,**
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : t and extreme sports.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So when Rebel was introduced to the public, there was only a minority of other and your d drink companies that were associating their beverages with productivity and extreme sports, so they just sold the product itself, didn't associate it with anything.
ch_0 : <Mhm> So I think the rideable is laudable and then and Starbucks they are having very common thing about good marketing strategy.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : So in South Korea there are many korean <uh> coffee shops, french coffee coffee franchise,
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : coffee franchises in my country.
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : But <uh> the coffee print charge hit up hit up and then hit up around 10 years ago. But
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : like 2000 2013 the in Korea the coffee franchise
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : Bloom blooming up but after 10 years later only
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : Starbucks and then coffee bean and tea leaves <uh> survived
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
**ch_0 : in South Korea.**
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : So so <yeah> why they are surviving when I when I I always think about that. What is the secret of them? The thing is good
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
**ch_0 : marketing strategy.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> We're definitely having a good marketing strategy, so you can stand out
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : from your competitors is very important, especially when the market is oversaturated or there's a lot of competitors who are doing it basically the same thing as you.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <mm> <mm>
ch_1 : <Um> Well I was looking at the sentence again and I think it's best to change it to when Rebel was introduced to the public, They stood out from their competitors by associating their beverages with productivity and extreme sports,
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : it sounds more smooth. And then you said the thing is not easy. I think he said easy when you drink coffee, you think of extreme sports. So here I think instead of saying the thing which is a bit <um> general and a bit vague so we can say
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : it is not easy to <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : associate**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : coffee with extreme sports
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : or**
**ch_0 : did not age.**
ch_1 : it's hard to be reminded,
**ch_0 : Text.**
ch_1 : it is hard to be reminded of extreme sports
**ch_0 : Mr**
ch_1 : when you drink coffee.
**ch_0 : <mhm>**
ch_1 : And then you also said what is a secret of them? So here we have to change it to what is their secret? It sounds more natural.
ch_0 : What is true? Okay.
ch_1 : <Mhm> Also do you have any questions at all?
ch_0 : <Mm> Watch so before last last <uh> lots of paragraph. So you <uh>
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : you told me it is hard to be reminded of extreme sports when you drink coffee. So <um>
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : please check my sentence in my head. So easy making sense.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : It is hard to be connected of extreme sports when you drink coffee. Is it making sense?
ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah> it's, I think the phrasing is a little bit awkward but you want to use connect that verb, you can say it's hard to
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : connect <uh> extreme sports with coffee.
ch_0 : hm You're hard to connect. <Mhm>
ch_1 : <Um> But <yeah> associated I think is the best word or the most fitting verb when talking about brands connecting like something else to their product.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : So associated. So that just means like when the customer drinks it, they'll be reminded of all these different things or if they see that thing they'll be reminded of the brand,
ch_0 : Okay, <mm> Ok <hmm> making sense.
ch_1 : <yep> awesome. Do you have any other questions
ch_0 : I don't have more.
ch_1 : awesome? Okay. <Um> also relating to their business strategy and how they had their famous saying like Red Bull gives you wings?
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> even though it's very successful for them and they're able to sell a lot of <um> rebel too, like maybe athletes or people who like to do extreme sports. <Um> the article mentioned that there was one person who filed a lawsuit against them because they're saying it was misleading
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : to say Rebel gives you wings. So what do you think about the lawsuit?
**ch_0 : The lawsuit**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <uh> actually <uh> I read the paragraph or the article but I don't know about russell.
ch_1 : <Ah> <Yeah> it was like in the second to last paragraph
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : <um> They said that one like customer in 2013 sued Red Bull
**ch_0 : entrance.**
ch_1 : because they said that they had misled customers about the benefits of the beverage and they said that Rebel give you wings.
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : It exaggerates too much because it actually doesn't give you wings.
**ch_0 : Thank you. <Uh>**
ch_1 : So I guess do you think the person was being like too picky, like just trying to find a way to sue them to get money or do you think their claim was actually reasonable and Rebel was exaggerating the benefits of their drinks?
ch_0 : <mm> <mm> <hmm> You know the marketing <uh> to do a successful marketing, you need to put some lies or
ch_1 : Thank you? <Mm> <hmm>
ch_0 : some story <uh> that people or interested in.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Mhm> So I think that the person is very picky.
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : The marketing is just marketing.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Mm> So the rubber company put <uh> fun story on
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : their beverage. I mean they did rebranded the rebranding
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but the guy was too picky.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <Yeah> I think so too. I think everyone mostly knows that
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : your teachings are not that healthy for you and that Rebel gives you wings. It's just a saying it's not supposed to be taken literally
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <um> <yeah> in America I feel like there's a big culture around lawsuits,
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_1 : like a lot of people like to, to companies, no matter how small the issue is, even if it's the customer's fault, they might try to find a way to sue the company. So is there a similar culture in Korea or not so much?
ch_0 : <mm> <mm> <Ah> nice for March.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : Actually when I visited Chicago around five years ago and then I heard a story
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : from my friend who is still living in America
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : at that time. He told me about your story. So the story about war old woman who bond by Mcdonald's coffee.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Uh> you know the coffee is always hot when you order just hot coffee
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but the woman sued the McD Mcdonalds
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
ch_0 : because <uh> on the cop there was no warning sign.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> because of that. Without the Mcdonald's didn't write down any warning on their copy cop
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : because of that because of the little bit of mistake. The woman won by us
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : sue. <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> I heard that story also like a while ago when I was younger, I remember thinking, wow, that is so crazy.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> Yes.**
ch_1 : Crazy have now all the coffee cups do have warnings on them like caution. It's hot. So her lawsuit actually had a big impact on how the cups were made.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> And then <yeah> the If the warm one lived in south Korea my country
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : she didn't she didn't win.
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
**ch_0 : <Huh> bye.**
**ch_1 : <Yeah> definitely. It's**
ch_0 : <Yeah> when she when she fought when she <uh> you know the Korea is the
**ch_1 : are you crazy?**
ch_0 : the americans bigger country then
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : Korea and then the su the lowest developed
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : what you do in Korea so <mhm>
**ch_1 : definitely. <Um>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : it's pretty crazy how it was mostly her fault and it's common sense that
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : coffee is hot but she still won the lawsuit which is I think
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : show us a little bit about like the american legal system and some of its flaws.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> a lot of companies like they tried to cover themselves as much as possible and they don't want any like liability earth, they don't allow certain things that are normally like
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : it won't be that big, big deal just because they don't want anybody to sue them. They have to be very careful <um> but in terms of a couple correct?
ch_0 : <Oh> <uh> sorry to bother you.
ch_1 : <Yeah> no, no problem.
ch_0 : So <yeah> nowadays I saw <uh> the su between the actor johnny Depp
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and the actress Amber Hood.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> the studios are very fun. So they
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : they divorced**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : around <uh> more than five years but
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : This is a 2022 they fought they fight again
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> it's pretty crazy like suing each other for defamation for like lying about the other person even though it was so long ago,
**ch_0 : <mm> <Uh>**
ch_1 : but <yeah> takes a long time.
ch_0 : and then you know they did the live streaming on Youtube. <Yeah> the thing is the news made me very very shocked
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Uh> Did you watch any of the trial?
ch_0 : <Mm> in my three no. <Yeah> actually I didn't but also from the newspaper.
ch_1 : <Uh> <huh> wow, it's crazy the news was so global
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : with the trial. <Um> but in terms of a couple of corrections you had said
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : you have to put some lies or some stories so that people are interested. So it's kind of sounds a little bit harsh to say directly say that companies have to lie because
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : it's kind of more like illegal for them to directly lie. So to make it sound a little bit softer, you can say in order to have a successful marketing campaign,
**ch_0 : <mm> <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : companies have to stretch the truth sometimes.
**ch_0 : What about**
ch_1 : So it stretched <mm> <hmm>
ch_0 : what about you could generate?
ch_1 : <Oh> <yeah> you could say exaggerate as well. Sometimes companies have to exaggerate that would be perfectly fine. But he said directly like it's a little bit too like honest.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> and then you did in the, if the women lived in South Korea, she didn't win. So here since we're talking about a hypothetical situation
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : that didn't happen, we can't say didn't win, which means like she actually went there and she wasn't successful.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So we have to use wood which is just talking about a possibility. So <yeah>
ch_0 : <Uh> Yes you're right.
ch_1 : There women lived in because she wouldn't have one.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : But <yeah> I do have any questions or last minute comments before. We just talked about overall feedback for this lesson.
ch_0 : <Yeah> <yeah> I'm good so I don't have a more question to you so I think it is time job.
ch_1 : Okay, awesome. <Mhm> awesome. <Yeah> I think you did a really good job with pronunciation and fluency in this lesson. It's very easy to understand you and you really don't have like an accent, it's it's very natural sounding. <Um> And influence e I thought you did a pretty good job answering quickly and your speech was pretty smooth without any hesitations which is great.
**ch_0 : <Uh> <huh>**
ch_1 : <Um> I think the main thing that we have to work on in this lesson is mostly vocabulary. <Uh> because sometimes using different vocabulary major message a little bit unclear.
ch_0 : I put Cavalleri. Okay. <Mhm>
ch_1 : <Um> But after you know asking you about it <um> with more follow up questions I was able to understand you more clearly.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : And then in terms of grammar <um> just mostly just small grammatical mistakes with maybe prepositions or missing a few words but overall they're more minor mistakes. The big thing is mostly just vocabulary.
ch_0 : <Mhm> Okay. Thank you so much. So after you, after this class I need to study more about focus.
ch_1 : No problem but your your english is still pretty good, just a couple spots to polish up on but overall still a very strong lesson. <Um> But <yeah> it was really nice meeting you today Simon and I hope you have a great rest of your day.
ch_0 : Okay, Have a good day.
ch_1 : Thank you, bye bye.
