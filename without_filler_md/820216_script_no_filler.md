ch_0 : Top Gun? <Oh> that was
**ch_1 : God,**
**ch_0 : so good.**
ch_1 : he wanted, he wanted to see it and I was like, I don't really like the big action movies where it's literally just, they go out and specifically they're just going out with their guns and shooting and blowing things up. It's not not very it's exciting, but it's not very interesting to me, but I do like the superhero movies a lot <um> and I thought the Avengers movie was good, but I also really loved venom. Is that that was good?
ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> that's good. <Yeah> but the top on is really
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : great movie. I think you should go watch with him.

ch_1 : it's okay, go ahead.
ch_0 : <um> I think you should go and watch it. It was, it's worth watching it in the movie theater. You should watch that in a big screen.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : Really enjoyed watching it. I want, I want to watch that second time but enough time. So

**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : And I just <um> and after watching the second movie, the new one. I really got interested in that series. So I watched the first one but I got back home after watching the second movie.

**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : the first or the second one was so good. I was like, let me see the original.
ch_0 : <Yeah> I don't, so I was the original one after watching the second movie. <Yeah>
ch_1 : Okay, which one did you think was better?
ch_0 : <Um> The first original one was really great. <Um> thinking of <mm> thinking of the ear that the movie was made, it was like 40 years ago. It was 30, 30 years ago. But the equality was so great.
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : <Um> <yeah> but I really enjoyed the 2nd 1.

ch_1 : I mean it's the musical
ch_0 : <Yeah> begin again was so good. <Yeah> I think those three and look as well.
**ch_1 : <ah> Classic.**
**ch_0 : It was.**
ch_1 : Okay, awesome. I I haven't really, I actually have not seen any of those because I'm a terrible person at watching movies. <Um> like I have a whole list of all the ones that I want to watch, but I just never do it <uh>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : because I don't, I don't know, I also, if I do watch a movie, I tend to watch scary movies. <Uh> I find them very exciting.
ch_0 : You're watching her movies.
ch_1 : <Yeah> I love horror movies.
ch_0 : <Oh> wow. Because I don't, I, I really don't enjoy watching scary movies. I hate scary things. So <yeah>
ch_1 : <Oh> gosh. I mean, I understand for the longest time. I was <um> very strongly and badly affected by like any kind of ghost or demon movie. If I watched it, I would enjoy it, but then I would have nightmares for a month afterwards.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Oh> <yeah>**
ch_1 : Okay. But I, I, I fixed that I forced, <yeah> I
**ch_0 : Really?**
ch_1 : got really tired of it because I wanted to watch the movies and enjoy them and then go on with my regular life. <Um> so I literally, one,
**ch_0 : Yes,**
ch_1 : one day I just decided I'm going to binge watch ghost movies until it doesn't freak me out anymore. So I did that with paranormal activity. I watched maybe like
**ch_0 : thank you.**
ch_1 : I think there's four or 5 of them. I watched all of them over the course of maybe like three nights and it wasn't like three days, like literally I would watch it after everyone else had gone to bed
**ch_0 : Yes. <Mhm> wow,**
ch_1 : and I just did that until, until it
**ch_0 : you're great. <Yeah>**
ch_1 : desensitized me. So now I get scared when I watch the movie, but then I go home and I can sleep like a baby, so
ch_0 : wow. To enjoy hurries, wow,
ch_1 : <mhm> <Yeah> it's it's fun? It doesn't, it doesn't work out very well because most people that I meet don't like them,
ch_0 : <mm> <hmm> <Yeah> I agree.
ch_1 : although my my best friend does like them. So that's that's fun.
ch_0 : <Mm> <hmm> It's good to have friends that can enjoy movie together.
**ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So are you very much into like K content movies or not really? Like did you see parasite? Okay.
ch_0 : <Yeah> I enjoy watching korean movies as well. And <yeah> I watched parasite, but it was scary though. I hate blood.
ch_1 : All right. But it was scary.
ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah> I don't know you watched it or not, but it's who blood thing at the ending. So
ch_1 : <Ah> <yeah> that was that was intense. I was I was so shocked.
**ch_0 : <yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Um> I didn't really think it was very scary, but I was like, like totally unexpected.
ch_0 : <Yeah> Yes. <Yeah> And it's, <yeah> I hate blood. So
ch_1 : Okay, so you really don't like gory.
ch_0 : <yeah> Kind of, <yeah>
ch_1 : Yes. Okay. Gotcha. So when you, when you watch like the movies and stuff like that, do you tend to watch it all in korean or do you do it in english?
ch_0 : <Um> if I watch Korea movie, I <um> I just watched that in korean and if I watch <um> english movie, I actually turn on the korean subtitle, <yeah>
ch_1 : <Mm> <hmm> Okay. Is that because it's just <uh> easier for you to understand or you don't feel like confident in your english abilities?
**ch_0 : <um> <um>**
**ch_1 : More comfortable?**
ch_0 : <yeah> it's more comfortable and it's also fun to like, <um> compare like <mm> for example if I understand some sentence in some way but the subtitle says in different way so I enjoy not enjoy but I sometimes <um> compare <um> my thoughts and the subtitle.
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : <Yeah> sometimes I don't understand why the translator <um> translated that sentence like that.
ch_1 : <Mm> Okay. Do you, do you think that ever helps you learn more?
ch_0 : <Yeah> I think it helps me. Two. <Yeah> I think it helps. <Mhm>
ch_1 : Okay, cool. I also, I tend to <um> I tend to watch shows so I'm studying italian of course since I'm living here. <Um> but I tend to watch shows with english audio and italian subtitles for the same reason because then I can kind of see how it might be translated how it might be written out and a lot of the time I'm also like
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : that's so weird. Why would you write it that way? But I think it has helped me because I am, I've picked up a lot more like you know like one or two word phrases here and there like exclamations that are very commonly used around me, I've been able to like pick up more on
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Oh>**
ch_1 : like some of the grammatical or not even grammatical structure, just some of the like sentence structure
**ch_0 : right,**
ch_1 : to feel a little more native, So cool, that's good.
ch_0 : have you, have you been learning italian? Like
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : how long have you been?
ch_1 : <Ah> <um> only since October so I've lived, I've lived here since August, no September 2020. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : But I moved originally to study to do a Master's and my program requires you to pass a language proficiency exam before you can graduate.
**ch_0 : wow.**
ch_1 : <Um> So I I did spanish because they required two years of study but I was only at the school for one year,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : so I did spanish since I had a background in it and it was only after I was able to like finish all of the proficiency requirements that I started studying italian,
**ch_0 : Yes, wow,**
ch_1 : so <yeah> so it hasn't quite been a year <um> but I think I'm doing pretty good so far because I'm studying on my own, so
ch_0 : <mm> that's cool. So you're doing like english spanish and italian
ch_1 : <uh> no I cut I cut spanish out,
**ch_0 : so <oh>**
**ch_1 : I'm gonna**
ch_0 : is it difficult to learn?
ch_1 : <um> no it's not really difficult to learn, it's just <um> so when I was in undergrad, I studied spanish and japanese together and that was okay.
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : <Um> But when I, when I first got here I was trying to study a little bit of italian alongside the spanish and that was it was just a mess, it was a big mess because they're too similar, so I was always confusing
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Oh>**
ch_1 : <uh> spanish for italian and vice versa, so for me like I think I'm gonna I'm gonna get back into japanese this summer <um> and start studying again, but that'll be easy because they're so different if it's if it's too similar like italian and spanish like they're similar enough that people like Italians can just go to spain and talk with
**ch_0 : really?**
**ch_1 : the locals. <Yeah>**
ch_0 : It's a lot similar.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : I didn't know that.
ch_1 : <Yeah> So even even when I was studying in, even when I was studying spanish <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : if someone didn't understand english, sometimes I would use spanish instead and they would
**ch_0 : Yes,**
