 : 
**ch_0 : Hello?**
ch_1 : Hello. Hi you're back

ch_1 : don't worry, don't worry. And
ch_0 : I think you're muted.
**ch_1 : <yeah>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah> I'm back.**
ch_1 : good good good. I'm glad
ch_0 : I had internet. Yes. <Yeah>
ch_1 : no worries, these things happen. Okay let's get started straight away then so we as we've lost a few minutes a class and so just to go over the structure quickly I noticed
**ch_0 : Yes. <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : I think last time we did a we had a discussion focus class but today we've got kind of intermittent paraphrasing. So <yeah> we'll go through kind of questions and I'll go through some corrections and paraphrasing after each question. Is that okay with you
ch_0 : <Mm> <Yeah> definitely sound good.
ch_1 : and any other kind of specific requests or areas to focus on in this class?
ch_0 : <Mm> No, I don't have any specific request. Just follow your, you know instruction and your guideline.
ch_1 : Okay great. Alright then let's get started then. So <yeah> the topic was about travel so if we start with the first question <uh> <Yeah> so what for you is the most fantastic destination or memorable country that you've ever traveled to? And would you visit again?
ch_0 : <Mm> <ah> <yeah> I've been made place and I still have many good memories about the places I ever before. But one A 1 a place I really want to go back. Is that my wife and I always talk about our honeymoon. So we went to Hawaii
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but since we went there we didn't have a chance to go hawaii. So one day, <yeah> really love to go Hawaii for another maybe anniversary things.
ch_1 : Nice. <Yeah> that that sounds amazing why what was it about Hawaii that you enjoyed so much? What what was it about the about the place that was so kind of memorable or? Amazing.
ch_0 : <Uh> <um> There are many beautiful beach and in a food good restaurant and you know that places you know well known for honeymoon place so you can feel that, feeling the happiness
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : all couple or family are having you know fun and happy smile. So it gave a happy happy virus things from, from them. <Yeah>
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : And so <yeah> definitely nature is good, <yep>
ch_1 : Okay so <yeah> whole whole list of reasons <yeah> that that sounds amazing. I'd love to go to Hawaii. I'm very jealous and so <yeah> you're planning on going back there. Have you have you just been there the one time for your honeymoon? That was the first time you visited that?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> it was the first time you have visiting when we have a honeymoon. <Yeah>
ch_1 : Okay. Nice. <Um> Okay that's great so <um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : okay now we can have a look at some paraphrasing corrections from the first question so <yeah> you can I think there's just a couple of kind of grammar errors here, but the rest sounded good. You could say you could say something like here, I'm lucky enough to have traveled <um> too many many amazing destinations around the world, so just adding a bit more kind of complexity of language there. <Um> <Yeah> you could say and have you could say something like and have <um> made <um> <yeah> <um> make some great memories.
**ch_0 : <Mm> <hmm>**
ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah> so that would maybe sound nice. You could say something like 11 place that stands out. <Um> <Yeah> stands out is hawaii <um> since it was
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : where my wife and I went on our honeymoon
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <um> You can say something like <um> ever since we <um> ever since we got back, <yeah> we have been <um> you can use this phrase. It might somewhere that you can say we've been threatening to to go back go back one day.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I haven't haven't <um> Oops around to it yet. So <yeah> I just kind of put some different phrases in here. Like I'm lucky enough to have traveled to many amazing destinations around the world. <Yeah> One place that stands out which is a nice expression to use kind of one, pick the best place.
ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm> No. <Mhm>
ch_1 : <Um> Ever since we got back. And then <yeah> if you can use this word threatening, we have been, if you say you're threatening to do something, it's not a bad thing, it means you're kind of
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Uh>**
ch_1 : you're suggesting it. <Yeah> if you say, you know, kind of I've been I've been threatening to go on holidays on vacation or on holiday soon. You're saying you're kind of
**ch_0 : <mm> <hmm> wow!**
ch_1 : you've been suggesting it, it's been a suggestion. It's kind of a it sounds weird to use that word that, but <um> it's a kind of a native expression I suppose. That would sound quite good there. And then <yeah> you can say we've been threatening to go back one day. <Yeah> I haven't I haven't got round to it. So if you say you get round to something, if you haven't
**ch_0 : <Ah> threatening. <Hmm>**
ch_1 : got around to something, it just means you haven't done it yet. <Um> <Yeah> there's a few kind of nice I think idiomatic expressions you could put in there
**ch_0 : <mm> Morning. <Yeah>**
ch_1 : and then the second bit you could say, you could say something like hawaii has so much to offer
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : these beautiful beaches. <Um> Because there's something like a great <um> great culinary scene or a great food scene.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : It's seen <um> as well as <um> <um> as well as being, you can say something like as well as being a romantic and <um>
**ch_0 : wow.**
ch_1 : <yeah> unhappy place. <Um> Did they? It's like you can sense <um> that everybody is enjoying themselves <um> <Yeah> so this is a nice specialties kind of has so much to offer meaning. There are so many great things about it
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and you're kind of a great culinary food scene as well as being a romantic and happy place. <Yeah> And then <yeah> you can sense that everybody you can say you can feel as well, but you can sense it's just another option. And then just this last sentence, I would just paraphrase this slightly and say
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : honeymoon <um> was the first time either of us had visited Hawaii. So
**ch_0 : Right.**
ch_1 : <um> <yeah> I would just restructure like that, that would sound a little bit more natural I think.
**ch_0 : <Ah> <yeah>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> Okay. Any questions so far about any of that vocabulary or paraphrasing or anything?
ch_0 : there is a culinary, what does he mean is
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : great culinary and food sins. So what does it mean culinary?
ch_1 : <Yeah> culinary just means anything related to food. So <um>
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : if it's just an ad, it's basically kind of the adjective for food so you'd say
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : and you know, I'm really interested in kind of culinary <um> taking I don't know, kind of culinary <um> books or kind of <Yeah> we often talk about the culinary scene which means, <yeah> the kind of the food scene, the food, what the food is like
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : or <Yeah> you might say that you have, you know some culinary experience meaning, you know, you've got experience cooking. <Um> It kind of just means related to food basically.
**ch_0 : <mm> Okay.**
ch_1 : And <yeah> does that make sense?
ch_0 : Thank you. Yes, definitely. Thank you.
ch_1 : Great. <Yeah> We often talk about some, you know has that particular city or country having a great culinary scene or great food.
**ch_0 : <Mm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So <yeah> Okay, great. Let's move on then. So maybe we can look out. I think the second, the second question is quite quite interesting quite a lot to talk about there. So how do you like to travel, Do you prefer hotels or a different form of accommodation, what kind of transportation going by yourself or in a group and or going kind of as an organized tour or just kind of going off by yourself and choosing what to do. What's your kind of favorite way or style of traveling?
ch_0 : <mm> normally our love to go alone with. I try. <Yeah> I try to go along rather than making some group too have trouble but since I got married you know I don't have many chances to go you know trade alone normally. <Yeah> I need to go with my wife and before I got married a lot of trouble. <Ah> Not luxury one it's just packed with a pack and have just travel whether it's just trained by train or by first <ah> after I got married you know my wife always want to luxurious way you know so I need to hope that you know flight rather than take a bus taking a bus or train and also I need to book the luxury so something different. What I really enjoy the people. <Yeah> <Uh>
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <yeah> always I try to make it three without my wife but always she said no no way going along.
ch_1 : She always wants to come. <Um> That's funny, that's funny. <Yeah> I guess that's that's often the way. Okay, interesting. And what do you think about the, do you quite enjoy having kind of a bit of luxury as well? Do you quite enjoy sometimes staying in a really nice hotel rather than kind of backpacking?
ch_0 : <Mm> <Yeah> I feel <yeah> I like you know a little bit luxurious one rather than going to you know you know how can I say I used to go a lot a lot <ah> place like like India I was living in India for two years and I had <um> any chance to go around India. So and as you can imagine India about India India is very it's not a luxury place and wherever you go there You can you can't find the luxury one but I really love that treat but now I'm getting older and I have a partner
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and and I'm little bit changed about my way of enjoying the truth so I I'm happy for you take a good accommodation and
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : you know lent lent a good car so so people can change the way of enjoying their life. I think I like more you know you know comfortable and convenient treat.
ch_1 : <Yeah> definitely. I think that's that's very true as as we get older we kind of we are standards kind of become a bit higher and our tolerance for maybe discomfort or inconvenience kind of goes down a bit. We've become, I definitely agree with that and
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : it's a good excuse. You can you can say that it's your your wife wants to stay in nice places, but then you also get to benefit from that, so use okay great, let's have a look then through the last few paragraphs <um> <Yeah> so you could say <um> something like I have always loved to travel by myself as opposed to in a group. <Um> However <um> since I got married <um> saying I don't <um> I don't often have the opportunity, community trouble <um> <Yeah> traveled by myself, <yeah> so I noticed a few times you said kind of
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I go alone, travel alone. So <yeah> you can always stay kind of travel by myself as well just to vary the language a bit and just use a connective in there <um> to kind of make it a bit more concise maybe. <Um>
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> you could say <um> say before it's a program married, I love to travel. <Yeah> you could say before before I got married <um> say <um> I you know, I usually <um> because then maybe I usually choose to travel <um> on a tighter budget <um> rather that <yeah> with little <um> luxury involved <um> such as <um> <um> getting around by train <um> bust. So <yeah> I think the structure used here was good kind of before I got married, so I kept that in there, you can see kind of travel on a tighter budget, so
**ch_0 : Okay. <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <yeah> kind of just with meaning with with less money on more of a budget
**ch_0 : Back up.**
ch_1 : <um> <Yeah> and then I think you said kind of with a pack, so we we'd probably just say backpacking, I went backpacking is how you would say it you say to go backpacking and that's kind of how you say it.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> Perfect. No**
**ch_1 : <Oh> <yeah>**
**ch_0 : <mm> <mm>**
ch_1 : okay. <Um> or you can just say I backpacked <um> people say as well and then <yeah> you can say maybe, <yeah> you can say kind of travel by bus, you can also say get around by bus or get around by train which is just a more informal native way of saying that.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_1 : <Um> And then here he said <um> maybe maybe say since after I got married I think you could say after I would probably just say since with some more natural hair maybe. <Yeah> since since getting married <um>
**ch_0 : <mm> <hmm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : they <um> was getting married I <um> <yeah> I you know I mostly <um> travel with my wife and and she <um> like she expects <um> luxury <um> <Yeah> <Yeah> I'm you could say maybe so I have no choice but to book of light rather than <um> <yeah> taking the bus
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : train. <Um> Okay. <Mhm> <Yeah> you could say <um> <Yeah> <um> I need to book luxury hotel. <Yeah> I think that's fine. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : Something different. <Yeah> you could say <um> also <um> <um> look more luxurious accommodation which is <um> not you know which is not what I'm used to <um> <Yeah> so you could maybe say it like that kind of rather than something different to what you enjoyed before and maybe say kind of which is not what I'm used to
**ch_0 : More <yeah>**
ch_1 : <um> would sound a bit more natural but I think the rest that sounded good. <Um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> you could say <um>
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : you could say more, you could say maybe <um> always I try to make a trip without my wife. You could say maybe just you could say whenever whenever I try whenever I try to book a trip without my wife because she is always <um> insistent.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> Oncoming <um> and <yeah> she was insistent on coming I think that's fine. <Yeah> so kind of meaning she's always wants to come, she won't let me because they maybe she won't take no for an answer. This is quite a nice idiom. If somebody, if you say that somebody doesn't take no for an answer it means
ch_0 : Right. <Mhm> <Yeah> <mm> No for an answer
ch_1 : that basically <yeah> they won't accept no if she says I want to come and you say no she won't say okay she'll kind of she only she will only stop when you say yes that's basically what that expression means. So that's quite quite a good idiom. You could use that as well. <Um> Let's look at this last paragraph then <um>
ch_0 : man. <Mhm> <Yeah> <Mhm> Right.
ch_1 : <yeah> you say <um> you could say <um> maybe something like although I'm not used to <um> luxury when I travel <um> actually we can put that in later I think you can say here <um> <yeah> you could say planning my experiences of traveling in the past maybe have been anything but luxurious
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : you can say for example in the past or for example you can say you know in my in my younger years I lived and
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : traveled around India which <um> and then I think you said as you can imagine <um> you see and as you can imagine <um> luxury is hard to come by
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : India. So <yeah> I used a couple of expressions here. So
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I said kind of my experiences have been anything but luxurious. So if you say anything but and then an adjective, you mean
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : they are just completely not luxurious. They've been everything else except for luxurious, luxurious is the last thing,
**ch_0 : <Yeah> Right.**
ch_1 : the last word you would use to describe it. So that's quite a nice expression then I put in my younger years or when you could just say when I was younger <yeah> I lived and traveled right India and as you can imagine, luxury is hard to come by. So if you say something is hard to come by, you mean it's
**ch_0 : <Yeah> Yes.**
ch_1 : it's not very common. <Um> It doesn't really exist there. So it's hard to find. So that's another good expression you could use
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : and then you could say maybe here having said that as I have <um> <Yeah> as I have got older <um> and since I got married <um> I have started to enjoy different, see I started doing different ways of traveling because of something like <um> I have no <um> about dang get in <um> nice accommodation.
**ch_0 : No.**
ch_1 : <Um> <um> You can say something like I'm fully believed people <um> Well people or people naturally change are they how they travel? <Yeah> as they get older. <Um> So <yeah> I think what you said here was good, I've just been a couple more kind of phrases like having said that, which means <um> kind of it's another way of saying however or on the other hand <um> <Yeah> I have you could use this phrase here I have no complaints.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> I think that was everything. <Um> any questions about any of that vocabulary or any of those expressions or anything?
ch_0 : No no thank you.
ch_1 : <Yeah> Okay everything is all useful so far.
ch_0 : <Yeah> everything is good. <Yeah>
ch_1 : Great. Okay so we've probably got one more time time for one more question. <Um> So maybe we can look at <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Maybe we can look at question eight it's quite interesting. <Um> Call me <um> Or maybe question five actually I think there'll be a bit more to talk about that. <Um> So so you talked about kind of when you were younger and your travel but how how do you look at travel now would you say it's an active experience or an opportunity to relax and maybe switch off from work?
**ch_0 : No.**
ch_1 : Would you like to fill when you travel? Do you like to fill your time with doing lots of interesting things?
ch_0 : <Ah> I reckon <um> doing doing travel he's <um> pretty much likely having experience a new experience. So when I took a chance to travel any country rather than staying hotel or some area I tried to explore another place to to see and to feel about the other objective and you know some different landscape and different people. So travel is much good opportunity having given good opportunity to know about the different <uh> thinking and different <uh> thought and experience as well and <um> and also nowadays I can feel that the travel is required for having relaxed by escaping from what you work for and what you live for around your boundary. So I think yes treat travel has to to remain <um> objective include having experience and also having good opportunity to lax.
ch_1 : <Mhm> definitely. I agree. Kind of sometimes you want to kind of go and immerse yourself in the culture and then other times
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : you want to just
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : maybe sit by sit on the beach and just relax. And what about do you do any kind of
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : do you ever travel for kind of a hobby like <um> you know people go on like ski holidays or golf holidays or walking holidays do you ever travel for kind of a hobby like that?
ch_0 : <Uh> <Yeah> when I was in Korea winter season normally go scheme because winter season we have good snow in Korea but in Australia <yeah> we have some mountain having a snow. It's not a good compared to what I enjoyed the skiing in Korea. So I had just one experience to enjoy skiing in Australia and so <yeah> I had a many many times many times to go skiing in winter season.
ch_1 : Nice. <Um> <Yeah> it's the same same with me, obviously we can't really ski in the U. K. But it's very close to go to France or <um>
**ch_0 : <Mm>**
ch_1 : Switzerland and it's <yeah> it's a great fun going on a skiing trip.
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Um> Okay great let's have a look then through the last question about five minutes left. And so <yeah> you could say here <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : you could say for me <um> you can say something like travel. <Um> You said kind of doing travel so I would say just going traveling or just
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : travel. Either traveling or going traveling but you wouldn't say kind of doing travel traveling or going traveling but you could say maybe for me travel <um> you could say is a great opportunity to experience something new. <Um> When I <um> you maybe you could say maybe so <um> okay so <yeah> whenever <um> chance to travel new country <um> I prefer to stay. <Um> <Yeah> you could say for not to stay in a hotel. <Um> And instead <um> maybe opt for something more <um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : more local so <yeah> you could say in this way I can <um> <Yeah> I think that's a nice expression to use immerse myself in the culture
**ch_0 : <mm> Okay. Marshall.**
ch_1 : <um> And <um> you can see maybe afraid we often uses and live like a local. <Um> So <yeah> I think I think I just kind of restructured the start of this where you said I reckon doing travelers pretty much likely having new experience, I think thing travel is a great opportunity to experience something new, this just sounds a bit more natural and kind of fluent
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> <Yeah> and then I think this is a <yeah> I just use this phrase kind of opt for which means kind of choose basically, I opt for choose <um> more local and then say this immerse myself in the culture as a nice expression if you immerse yourself in something, you just kind of
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : really embrace it and kind of throw yourself into it and you live like a local is a nice expression I think that's kind of what you were saying, you kind of when you kind of go to eat at the local places and you do the local activities, it's a nice expression to use that
**ch_0 : <Yeah> Yes <mm>**
ch_1 : and you could say <um> I think this was actually kind of <yeah> you could say you say well say something like well I have always seen travel as <um> <yeah> it's a good like you said good opportunity <um> <um> to experience new ways of <um> thinking and <um> <yeah> to experience new <um> and <um> <yeah> you could say kind of embrace <um> the new culture <um> you could say nowadays I am starting to appreciate <um> I'll travel <um> come that can help us relax and escape from just maybe you can make these two centers to say how fast
**ch_0 : <Mhm> No.**
ch_1 : relax <um> say <um> you can say something like more and more I <um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : okay I more and more I think or I find travel <um> important for <um> <yeah> escaping work and or escaping maybe the day the day today. <Um> Okay thing my day to day life and switching off from what so <um> <yeah> I would say <um> you wouldn't say you said
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Yeah> one more.
ch_1 : travel is required for having relaxed, you wouldn't say for having relaxed, you just say for relaxing and
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : but <yeah> I kind of just link these two together, you can maybe say I'm starting to appreciate and then more and more so meaning kind of just <yeah> you're becoming, you think this more and more <um> <Yeah> and switching off from is a really nice expression, we often talk about traveling to switch off from something and
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <mm> Yes.**
ch_1 : <yeah> so then you could say <um> <yeah> you could say <um> so you could let me think <um> <Yeah> you could say I would now and I would now say that travel <um> So you could say maybe, I think what you said it was fine about two main objectives objectives. You could also say I would now say that travel is really important for having new experiences <um>
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <um> <Oh> <yeah> having new experiences as well as <um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : but <yeah> relaxing <um>
**ch_0 : that's**
ch_1 : So <yeah> that would be a nice expression to use that as well and then this last one here. So you said thank you, <yeah> when when I was in Korea or <yeah> <yeah> when I was living in Korea and I would <um> <Yeah> so you can use, you would use this tent here when I was living for it. I would go usually go skiing <yeah> every winter <um> since we had such
**ch_0 : <mhm>**
ch_1 : good snow for it. <Um> So <yeah> you can, I would use this tense saying I would go, so you can use this tense, I would do something, you know when I was there I would do this which is used for kind of repeated or repeated actions in the past. So something you kind of regularly did in the past, you can use that tent. I would usually go skiing. <Yeah> since we had such a good snow for it.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Um> Say <um> say maybe in contrast <um> In contrast, although we do have some mountain you said having, so I think they say maybe
**ch_0 : wow.**
ch_1 : with snow or snow covered mountains, you can say well <um> Australia is not good compared to what I enjoyed in Korea. So you could say it's nothing,
**ch_0 : <Mhm> that's nothing**
ch_1 : it's nothing compared to what we had
**ch_0 : I'm sorry.**
**ch_1 : in Korea.**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah> you could say <um> had just one, <Yeah> one good experience the skin in a straight. <Um> I noticed you said <um> one good experience to enjoy skiing in Australia. So <yeah> we say one good experience
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : of skiing of skiing or of enjoying skiing, but you wouldn't <Yeah>
**ch_0 : Obviously.**
ch_1 : <yeah> Of enjoying or enjoying <um> <Yeah> okay. <Um> he said since I have many time, <um> we are able to say, I think the grammar here is just slightly wrong, you say? <Um> Probably just I went skiing for many times in winter. <Um> <Yeah> you don't need to say kind of in winter season, you can just say in winter and we often would just say in winter rather than in winter season.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Um> But <yeah> okay. Any questions about any of the grammar or vocabulary from the last few paraphrasing there?
**ch_0 : No.**
**ch_1 : No. Okay.**
**ch_0 : <Oh> good.**
ch_1 : Hopefully everything is clear and there'll be some good kind of suggestions, suggested phrases to be there. But <yeah> I think in general, like I said last time everything was very clear and your points. <Yeah> we're all really clear and you use some really good structures and things. I would just say maybe try and use some more of those idiomatic expressions that I used and occasionally just kind of
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : the structure or the tenants wasn't quite right. So just have a look at where I where I corrected those as well. <Um> <Yeah> okay, then. I think that's everything like I did last night, pop all of the feedback and everything on their feet so you can see that.
ch_0 : <Yeah> All right thank you Julia
ch_1 : Thank you very much, David, and then enjoy the rest of your week and your weekend.
ch_0 : thank you. You also have a good day and hopefully see you around.
**ch_1 : They**
**ch_0 : Bye bye**
ch_1 : <yeah> you, bye, bye bye.
