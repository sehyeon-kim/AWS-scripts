**ch_0 : Okay. Okay. Okay.**
ch_1 : <yeah> so hello, my name is Allen and I'm currently a student at Princeton University where I'm majoring in electrical engineering, so next year will be my second year, but I'm also <um> mina ring in english and linguistics, so very broad interest and I'm looking forward to meeting you more today. So
**ch_0 : <Yeah> <mm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : you tell me a little bit more about yourself.

ch_1 : I think my favorite part is probably meeting you know, new people, so you know I've been able to meet little kids or professionals, so <um> tons of different people from all different walks of life and that's been really really interesting to me.
ch_0 : <mm> <hmm> Right. Yes. Yes. <Mm> <hmm>
ch_1 : So I looked in your specific lesson request and you wanted to know more about my experience with humanitarian engineering, which is something that I've been working on since high school. <Um> You also wanted to know more about new york city, which is a very interesting city. So yes, I will begin by talking more about my experience with humanitarian engine.
ch_0 : Yes <mm> <Yeah> <Mhm> <mm>
ch_1 : So as you know, I am an electrical engineering major at Princeton. <Um> but
**ch_0 : All right.**
ch_1 : in my free, in my free time I like to apply my engineering experience <um> to developing new solutions and new devices for humanitarian aid purposes. So this is <um> primarily to help people and to help others. So
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_1 : <um> can you see the lesson notes? Are you able to see it?
**ch_0 : Just yes yes.**
ch_1 : Yes. So if you look at the first picture, this is something that I've been working on for three years now. <Um> it is an exoskeleton for Children with disabilities, <um> specifically
**ch_0 : <Mhm> All right.**
ch_1 : Children with cerebral quality. So I'm not sure if you are familiar with cerebral palsy, but I left the korean translation for cerebral palsy down in the bottom. So, <um> this device is intended for little kids who have trouble with walking running, so who have mobility issues. So this is working on?
ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm> Right. Right. Right. Could you could you speak slowly please?
ch_1 : <Oh> yes, I'm sorry.
ch_0 : Two? It's okay. It's okay.
**ch_1 : <Yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_0 : I couldn't understand what you say but
**ch_1 : And**
ch_0 : it's a little bit please. A little bit slower please. Yes.
ch_1 : Okay. Yes, definitely. Okay, so, <um> yes, this is the device that I've been working on for a few years. And <um> so what I work on specifically is I work on the electrical aspect.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So I developed the circuits involved. <Um> I also do some of these simulations, so I can show you some simulations later if you're interested. <Um> but that's something that I have been working on. And the second thing that I've been working on is known as a wood chip bioreactor. So oftentimes, especially in America,
ch_0 : All right <mm> <mm>
ch_1 : <um> there are these environmental issues known as algal blooms where we see a lot of algae developing in ponds or lakes. So this algae is very harmful both to humans and to the fish.
**ch_0 : <mm> <mm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : So this is a solution
ch_0 : Excuse me. Excuse me. RG RG
ch_1 : algae. So let me see if I can find it. <Yeah>
ch_0 : R G. Could you put the the the the
**ch_1 : Yes.**
**ch_0 : words**
ch_1 : So I'm not sure.
**ch_0 : <oh>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> I can put a picture too.
ch_0 : I but looms I didn't know that.
ch_1 : <Yeah> so this is a very, very large issue <um> in America right now because of the amount of chemicals in the water. So these chemicals contribute to the growth of this algae over here. <Um> and this is the solution that I have been working on <um> with Sweden the country and with Australia
ch_0 : <Mm> <mm> <mm> <mm>
**ch_1 : <um>**
**ch_0 : All right.**
ch_1 : and we implement these into local ecosystems and local lakes. So <yeah> very interesting stuff. Do you have any questions?
ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> So you you are doing the I mean skeleton.
ch_1 : <Mm> The extra scale?
ch_0 : So it's it's <um> it's good for disabled for the disabled. Right.
ch_1 : <Yeah> Yes, just a little.
ch_0 : It's really I think it's really really wonderful challenging <uh>
ch_1 : Yes, this is correct. <Mhm>
ch_0 : human human human for human. And another one is I think it's totally different from quasi skeleton.
**ch_1 : And**
**ch_0 : Exoskeleton.**
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
**ch_0 : So <uh>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> it is, it is very different.
ch_0 : yes you you were interest your interest is. Right. Right.
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <Uh> So <uh> it's it's this is good. So you you <um> you currently you
**ch_1 : So <yeah>**
ch_0 : <uh> interested in the environmental issues? Right.
ch_1 : Yes, this is correct,
ch_0 : The swish in the water. So how can I pronounce our blooms.
ch_1 : <yeah> <Yeah> so it's algal blooms so you want to make sure you pronounce the el correctly. Yes algal blooms. Yes,
ch_0 : Aigle brooms, brooms, algal blooms. Algal blooms means means
**ch_1 : that's perfect.**
ch_0 : <um> it's training I'm in the water water
**ch_1 : <Mhm> Yes.**
ch_0 : water system watering system for the plant right?
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> Yes, this is correct.
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
**ch_1 : So <yeah>**
ch_0 : so who needs who who needs the system
ch_1 : so this system is mainly
**ch_0 : everyone <mm>**
ch_1 : yes, everyone, it's mainly used by governments which is why I've been working with foreign nations because if we continue to let this LG stay <um> it will degenerate. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that word, so degenerate means to weaken.
**ch_0 : <mm> <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_1 : So it will weaken <um> infrastructure and pipes and it will <um> release toxins into the water that are very harmful to people <um> and to local animals. So this is something that the government has been funding and the government has been implementing.
ch_0 : <Mhm> Alright. Alright it's awesome.
ch_1 : <Yeah> thank you. <Yeah>
ch_0 : It's really really challenging <um> challenging. How can I say challenging
ch_1 : Yes. <Um> you can say it's a challenging problem
ch_0 : challenging task, challenging task
ch_1 : charging past, That's that's correct.
ch_0 : <mm> I think you're clever
ch_1 : So thank you. So even though it's very challenging, I enjoy working on it a lot
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : and my cousin actually who lives in Asia has cerebral palsy, so she is disabled,
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : which is the reason why I've been working on the first solution because you know this is an issue that is very close to me very near to me, so <um> I don't mind working on it, I find it very enjoyable and you know anyway that I can give back to that community
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mm>**
ch_1 : is something that I will do and <yeah>
ch_0 : Alright well what what what <uh> what did you lead <uh> that kind of challenging?
ch_1 : <um> could you rephrase that question a little?
ch_0 : It's a strange question. Right? Could you para price
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : to paraphrase?**
ch_1 : so <um> let me let me try to, so what are you trying to <um> what are you trying to ask
ch_0 : What do you lead late what do you lead <um> your interest? I mean the
ch_1 : my position in this process? So
ch_0 : what makes you what makes you,
ch_1 : what makes you interested in these
**ch_0 : yes yes yes.**
**ch_1 : challenges?**
ch_0 : What makes you interested in is your right
ch_1 : So what makes you interested? <Yeah> so <um> why are you interested in these challenges or?
ch_0 : yes yes yes that's right
**ch_1 : Yes, <Yeah> so**
ch_0 : that's right. Why are you interested in these challenges? Right I forgot many things
ch_1 : so the verb here is interested, which is the one you want to look for
**ch_0 : yes yes**
ch_1 : <um> but I think,
ch_0 : I say I understand.
ch_1 : <yeah> I think the reason that I'm interested in these challenges is because <um> I believe that we have to come together and develop solutions together
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_1 : to the problems that we're facing <um> I think it's very important that we are actively working towards solutions for these problems and <um> I feel a sense of urgency, so this is why I'm working on these issues personally for me.
ch_0 : <Mhm> Alright. In Korea there are so many concerns about <um> bsg it means <um> economically socially and environmental
**ch_1 : <Uh> <huh>**
ch_0 : environmental social so social <um> economical <um> governmental issues are everywhere we said E. S. G. System.
**ch_1 : <Oh> <huh>**
ch_0 : <Uh> So <uh> every single <um> company
**ch_1 : thank you**
ch_0 : has to has to to help you to <um> <mm> kip

ch_0 : the rules of E. S. G. System
**ch_1 : <Oh> I see**
**ch_0 : me?**
ch_1 : I I know exactly what you mean. I've heard about the korean dsG system before. So one way that we can rephrase this

ch_1 : <um> is the korean
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : heard? See oops the korean government it's particularly concerned where E. S. G.
**ch_0 : All right.**
ch_1 : For environmental and social issues. So
**ch_0 : All right**
ch_1 : <um> your method your way of saying it is understandable but my way of saying it would be a little more formal and <um> a little more fluent. So here we have concerned as the verdict we want to say the government is concerned.
ch_0 : <mm> <Oh> yes yes.
ch_1 : <Um> Instead of saying there are many concerns because there are is very passive. So this is a direct relation between the government and these concerns
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : <um>**
**ch_0 : All right.**
ch_1 : Because of the E. S. G. Regulations laws,
**ch_0 : All right.**

ch_0 : out here we're follow.
ch_1 : follow that <um> These
ch_0 : <Mhm> Better these rules. Okay.
ch_1 : <yeah> so the korean government is particularly concerned with E. S. G. Or environmental and social issues because of the E. S. G. Regulations law standards or system
