 : 
**ch_1 : Okay. Hello?**
**ch_0 : Thanks. Hello.**
**ch_1 : <Yeah> of course,**
**ch_0 : Hello.**
ch_1 : I how are you doing? You okay?
ch_0 : <Yeah> Right, how about you?
ch_1 : I'm okay. <Yeah> <Yeah> not bad at all. Your your microphone is a bit echoey. <Uh>
ch_0 : <Oh> okay. That now is it? Okay.
ch_1 : <Yeah> it's alright, don't worry right, so I'll just introduce myself a little bit. I mean you might have seen on my Ringle profile that my name is Ben. I'm a now Lord graduate from Durham University so I finished my degree, I'm hoping to become a lawyer in the next maybe two or 3 years after training and work experience, that sort of stuff. So <yeah> quite hard work left to do but done quite a bit of already. So <yeah> that's me really, which I say a little bit about yourself and then maybe a little bit about how you want this lesson to run and then we can get going.
ch_0 : <Um> <um> you saw from Korea and currently <um> first <um> grade student, college students? <Yeah>
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> and I was good vocabularies and maybe some grammar correcting. <Yeah>
ch_1 : Sounds good. <Yeah> so shall I ask you some of the questions here, is that okay? Ask you some of the questions, we'll go through them. Would you prefer to have a normal conversation and then <um>
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : normal conversation or questions? What do you think?
**ch_0 : <Um> everyone. <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> Okay, alright, so to be fair we'll start with one of the questions. So as you're a college student, have you ever felt burnt out from overworking? So have you ever felt kind of exhausted and tired and kind of they call it academic burnout I guess when you just feel that you can't study anymore?
ch_0 : <Yeah> Well by having through some exam period <yeah> absolutely. I feel existed and right now recently it's like holiday right now. So <um> and actually I had a great time too trouble so certainly I hadn't feel so, I mean I haven't felt so. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Mm> <Yeah> I think I felt it, especially during exam times. For sure. Where I just feel as though after I finished, I just kind of sit there for a few days and do nothing and I just it feels odd not working in a way when you've worked all year and then your exams are done then you're on holiday feels really strange
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : that it's nice to have a break. I always think how are your what are you studying at university or at college?
ch_0 : <Um> it is a philosophy.
**ch_1 : Nice.**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So what what sort of modules have you done, what sort of like topics have you covered?
ch_0 : <Um> because since it's just a first grade there's no particular more practical I guess. <Yeah> like a condor medal of like that stuffy isn't battle yet
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : so it's more like and three. <Yeah>
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> I think it's I never I was always quite interested in philosophy when I was younger and then I never chose to do it at school when I was at like high school because I didn't really like the teacher. I thought he was a little bit weird.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : I didn't really like him as a person so I didn't choose that topic.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : I think in hindsight I probably would have chosen thing. So it looks quite interesting. But.
**ch_0 : <Oh>**
**ch_1 : <Yeah> <Yeah> So**
ch_0 : you think so? Because your life is like in here in Korea it is most not a popular major and it's really the most to get a job. <Yeah> No. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <yeah> I think <yeah> I think to be fair in Korea I think there's obviously quite a heavy focus on employment afterwards and I guess there is in the U. K. As well in the US I think there's just a bit more there's a few more people doing philosophy in the UK granted it's not as popular as something like law or medicine or mathematics or physics stuff like that but
**ch_0 : similar.**
ch_1 : I don't know I don't think I don't think we should think in terms of employability I guess I'm guilty of doing that because I would have done history probably if I didn't I wasn't worried about getting a job afterwards but <yeah> I think if I could have done it again I probably would have chosen history over law. I think I'm more interested in it for sure. But <yeah> I've enjoyed it anyway but I mean do you
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : is that is that putting you off choosing philosophy as your major?
ch_0 : <Um> you mean the reason to choose?
ch_1 : <Yeah> Is it is the fact that you're worried about getting a job afterwards? So finding employment afterwards is that making you
**ch_0 : <Um>**
ch_1 : less want to do philosophy is a major?
ch_0 : well actually I I don't think I'm the person who could be part of some company. Like the structure of company isn't for me. <Yeah> I mean most of the people doesn't think their best for them but <yeah> you know the structure is kind of three. So
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : okay I just when I preparing the college exam either it will be great to choose that. A major. That <mm> Last stressful I guess because it doesn't matter where I go to make money. <Yeah> it doesn't really relate it with me.
ch_1 : <mm> <Yeah> I think you should choose what you enjoy to be honest. I think you should choose what you enjoy doing
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : especially when you're an undergraduate. I think you should choose what you enjoy doing and then if you want to become I don't know a lawyer later adopter later something else later if that all of a sudden becomes what you want to do, you can always do that after you've done something that you enjoy that would be my advice. I know it sounds as if I'm being very hypocritical because I've chosen to do a law degree but
**ch_0 : No.**
ch_1 : I honestly I honestly think that you should try and do something that you enjoy because I wish that I did if I'm honest
ch_0 : <Yeah> I can see that because you could tell me like that because you have experienced that you know?
**ch_1 : <mm>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> exactly and I think no no I think I think I was lucky in the sense that I actually enjoyed doing law at university because I think I chose to do it,
**ch_0 : Right**
ch_1 : but I didn't really know what it was going to be like. So I kind of chose to do law as a degree without knowing anything about or really before I did it and then I was just lucky that when I got to university I found the modules interesting. I found the teaching interesting. I found the subject interesting so it didn't work out too badly for me. But I know of people who've chosen to do something like law or medicine over doing something that they really enjoyed and then they've regretted it a lot afterwards.
**ch_0 : okay.**
ch_1 : So <yeah> I think definitely choose what you want to do. 100%.
ch_0 : Okay. So you mean if I say something that don't want it would be some kind sustainable.
ch_1 : <Yeah> because he because he wouldn't you wouldn't enjoy it.
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I think so if you I chose to do something because you were scared about getting a job or your parents pressured you into it or something like that,
ch_0 : <Yeah> I guess it's like typical problem, you know what's the most valuable or what's most important to just person? <Yeah>
ch_1 : enjoy it. <Yeah> no, you're right. I think it's it's such a difficult dilemma when you go to university because I think there's a there's a I think especially in like korean culture especially there's a big pressure to get a job afterwards and there's quite a lot of academic pressure,
**ch_0 : Right.**
ch_1 : employment pressure to be fair that exists in the UK as well
**ch_0 : Thanks.**
ch_1 : but maybe to a different degree. So
**ch_0 : Right.**
ch_1 : <yeah> I think as much as you can resist that pressure and do like what you want to do if you're really passionate about it and if you're really interested in it definitely.
ch_0 : <Yeah> I think so because <yeah> but I'm not sure about do I have any passion for philosophy? <Yeah>
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : this**
ch_1 : I think you've got time to decide though really? I think you've got time to say, well you got time to think about what you want to do and whether you enjoy it and people have time to actually kind of, especially if your, have you started college yet or are you about to go to college next year in september?
ch_0 : <um> I'm actually thinking about to break my sematary so <yeah> I don't know yet.
ch_1 : <Mm> Okay. <Yeah> but I think you've got you've got time for sure to decide.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> Right.**
**ch_1 : <Uh>**
**ch_0 : <Um>**
ch_1 : Alright, I'm gonna ask you another question. No no no no no no no no no, <mm> I was scared. Do you feel like you need to be as perfect as you can be in your life
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : or in your career?
ch_0 : <mm> like most of the people making gold or idea that they want to be and how they look like third <um> because just the idea <um> it really has some distance with reality of real me. So
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : I always scab pressure to to be her pact and to be ideal that I'm myself. Maybe it's because I care about other people's thinking other people's opinion. How do I like to them like this stuff?
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> I think people have this same problem and how are you?
ch_1 : <mm> <Yeah> I think I do tend to be a bit of a perfectionist, that's what you'd say about somebody who always wants to be perfect, you call them a perfectionist.
**ch_0 : <Um>**
ch_1 : So nothing is ever good enough, You must always try and be perfect even though
**ch_0 : <uh>**
ch_1 : being perfect is impossible really. <Um> but I think I can be a bit of a perfectionist, especially with like university work and with like studying and that sort of stuff and like job applications, I can, I think I can always try always try really hard to make it as perfect as I can do, but I think
**ch_0 : and**
ch_1 : sometimes that's kind of not practical, so sometimes trying to be perfect can actually hinder your work and make it worse in my opinion because I think you can
**ch_0 : <oh>**
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : because you put you too much
ch_1 : <mm> exactly you do too much and
**ch_0 : and**
ch_1 : sometimes when you do too much there's a phrase in english called it's just less is more sometimes
ch_0 : <yeah> maybe it's because I can't except I can't consider myself life really I am like like
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : <um> even if I have the ability to achievement I don't want to just consider <yeah> I don't want to see it's really me.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <yeah> I think that's it's a balance really, I think it's a balance between obviously trying your hardest and obviously like doing the best you can but then also making sure that you're still being true to yourself and you're being practical I guess so you're not trying to do too much and you're only trying to do as much as you can but that has limitations on it so you don't try and do too much, it's interesting. For sure
ch_0 : Yes I I tried to but you know it always doesn't really work.
ch_1 : <mm> for sure. So I mean what's I mean do you know what sort of things make you happy or sad? So like what sort of things do you kind of feel
**ch_0 : <Huh>**
ch_1 : do you get enjoyment from or? <Oh> I think you're on mute
**ch_0 : <Oh> <yeah> <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I should say. <Yeah> what sort of things make you happy or sad?
ch_0 : Well that's the problem of my life because I can't usually feel happiness in my life and I'm not sure even other people do. They have stop. <Yeah> because <um> absolutely <um> having through all some experience and just when I my age is increasing, it's what I realize is. So my life and my mentality is not really hopeful. Like there is no no interesting thing to me. So
**ch_1 : <Oh>**
ch_0 : <yeah> it's not really depressed then. It sounds like. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <yeah> <yeah> I think it's
**ch_0 : That**
ch_1 : it's one of those things where things are always less interesting when you get older I realized now that I don't really experience like childlike joy in the same way as I did
**ch_0 : what?**
ch_1 : When I was like 10 years old which is sad
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : and when you grow up you kind of realize that
**ch_0 : No.**
ch_1 : I don't know I think you kind of realize your own problems as well as your own
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : but you still things still make me happy but I think you realize your own problems and your own issues
**ch_0 : Back.**
ch_1 : lot more than you do when you're a child, that's what I've always found, so when I'm older I will be happy about things but when I kind of know something is wrong, I don't kind of ignore it very well, it kind of plays in my mind and then I can't really get rid of it, that makes sense.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
**ch_1 : Nice.**
ch_0 : <Yeah> Maybe maybe I need to find something
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : incredibly interesting. Me. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <yeah> you could find a hobby or something, what do you enjoy doing in your spare time? You enjoy like I don't know playing sport or drawing or art or music?
ch_0 : <Um> I used to like to draw but when I started this with mike <um> for my college exam once I was prepared the <um> design major. So I was supposed to run some really professional art
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and turns out it just doesn't suit me. So I lost interesting from that. And you know it's a typical story <um> you used to like it but when it becomes your duty it doesn't really, you know you almost hate.
**ch_1 : <mhm> <Yeah> <yeah>**
ch_0 : <Yeah> So I lost my art from my life and
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : right now curly they do <um> reading cough a. We're making some like waiting. <Yeah> that's my hobby maybe. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <mm> <Yeah> and that's a good hobby because I think for me I always enjoy whenever I feel quite upset I was try and go and do some exercise, that's what I've always tried to do, so I either go and play some sports or go running or go and play golf or something like that I think just being outside and not stuck in my room
ch_0 : You're removing your adults.
ch_1 : <mhm> <yeah> exactly, I like going outside and experiencing nature, it sounds a little bit
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : odd but I don't know I enjoy going outside and playing sport and doing exercise, I think it releases a lot of positive endorphins in your brain and makes you feel a lot better I always think
ch_0 : <Yeah> Actually I haven't experienced that kind of feeling yet because I always trying to get face some anxiety or problems and it's really scary with. <Yeah>
**ch_1 : <mhm>**
ch_0 : that <um> when I was younger than now I don't do the wondering or losing the way is most frightening thing in my life because it feels so unstable and it feels
**ch_1 : <yeah>**
ch_0 : <yeah> that's off. So I try I try to avoid them the right right now I changed my mind because if I don't wondering, I mean if I don't lose my weight, I didn't mean I don't think about right now and I think about what I'm doing right now and what I'm gonna do for my gold.
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : You mean I'm just leaving for just present, but no thinking about that, no consider about that and no regrets. No, just that kind of many <um> lose my the value of my what I'm doing. <Yeah> I can really kind of made the values to what I'm doing if I don't think about right now. So after I thought like that it just changed my mind, like maybe it was my way isn't really bad and everything because it's a chance to think about my life again and rearrange my gold. <Yeah>
ch_1 : <yeah> I always think I don't know this sounds quite deep but I suppose you're a philosophy or you're going to study philosophy at university or college so always think that even though kind of life is a little bit meaningless in a way but nothing, we don't really know what happens, we don't really know where we go. I was thinking if you can take joy in the fact that has no meaning and just have fun. I would think that's kind of my approach to it. So I don't really trying to have my own goals and try to have my own
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : like ideas but I think if those ideas or goals don't really work out for me, if I don't if they don't succeed then
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I don't know I was trying to take comfort in the fact that it's all kind of meaningless and as long as I'm just trying to have fun then it doesn't really matter.
ch_0 : right. Like when I feel like dumb myself, it's it also like my life and what I'm doing is meaningless because I don't know, it's just is more I feel I'm losing my motivation,
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : why why am I doing this like this. <Yeah> I'm just losing that and <yeah> I feel wondering as well.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <yeah> no I know what you mean, I think it's I think you're you're at a difficult time because you're about to start college and you're not sure what you want to do after college
**ch_0 : <Hmm>**
**ch_1 : and**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : it's a tough decision making time for you because you don't know
**ch_0 : In the pub**
ch_1 : what's going to happen after college, but <yeah> I think you should enjoy your time then I think
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : often when you don't know what you want to do afterwards, you happen to find something that you enjoy or eventually you find something that you want to do. For sure
ch_0 : And <yeah> maybe I feel anxiety because I don't really have certain gold.
**ch_1 : <mm>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
**ch_1 : Okay**
ch_0 : first when I, when I plan my gold, you feel more anxiety to me because
**ch_1 : <yeah>**
ch_0 : if you like Barton, especially the term of planning, I mean, term of plan is longer,
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : the pardon is pressure is deeper, So <yeah> trying to focus right now and
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <yeah> you know, I gave my way to like 10 kg. That's right, <yeah>
ch_1 : <mm> that does happen I think it's it is a really anxious time but I think if I'm honest with you I don't think you should worry about <um> finding something after university because I think just enjoy your time at college have fun enjoy it. And then a lot of my friends at university don't really know what they want to do after university so they don't they're not thinking <oh> I'm going to be a lawyer, I'm going to be a doctor, I'm going to be a engineer. They're not thinking any of those things they just don't know and they've done their degrees and
**ch_0 : and**
ch_1 : different subjects so geography or english literature or history that sort of stuff but they just don't know what's going to happen after uni at the university rather so <yeah> I wouldn't worry about it I think it's quite normal not to know what you want to do and I wouldn't feel pressure because people around you are saying <oh> I'm going to be a lawyer I'm going to be a doctor I wouldn't feel that sort of pressure if I were you we'll try not to anyway I know it's difficult.
ch_0 : <yeah> <yeah> you're right because <um> everyone does this <uh> baby, maybe why I feel about my <um> and me, the thing is <uh> many people leading the life there are like, that's most important in their life, in their life, like college for the job after
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : to focus on now and if they loved it, I mean, they they folded like blue in. <Yeah>
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : what, what I feel about meanness in my life is because of that. So, the we we all know about the walk where is happiness and what kind of thing could bring us happiness? The taking gold, I don't know, is it for happiness or just some kind of illusion like that. You feel like meanness obviously.
ch_1 : <mm> <Yeah> I think
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I kind of agree because I think happiness is so difficult to find it so and it means different things to different people and different people will find happiness doing completely different things. So I don't know, I think happiness can come from something meaningless in my opinion, you can be doing something completely meaningless and it doesn't matter if it makes you happy. I mean for example it makes me happy to go for a run or to go and play sport. In reality that is completely meaningless. It's a game made up by human beings with no consequence whatsoever on anything
**ch_0 : but**
ch_1 : and it just makes me happy to play it. I don't really know why and that's why it's happy. It is so difficult because finding it doesn't really meet have to be like a certain path. You don't have to take a certain path to find happiness. Like you don't have to be a doctor or a lawyer or engineer, whatever,
**ch_0 : anyone**
ch_1 : you don't have to go down the same path as everybody else to make yourself happy. You can do simply what makes you happy or you'll find something that makes you happy.
ch_0 : <yeah> Mr <um> some kind of questions like <um> the acting of pursuing that happens.
**ch_1 : <Mm>**
ch_0 : It's kind of weird because pursuing and we just we can only pursuing cabinets, but it doesn't make it happy, you know, that doesn't make us happy and maybe make us feel miserable and proud because we couldn't call back <Yeah>
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : I don't know what I'm talking but it's literally the acting of happiness like
**ch_1 : Then**
ch_0 : I don't know, I'm trying to get
ch_1 : <yeah> I know you I know you're trying to say, I think
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : sometimes chasing happiness makes us unhappy because I think we have an idea in our heads about what will make us happy and sometimes you're trying to achieve that, but you just can't and then that makes you unhappy because I've I've had that before. I think it's quite a common thing,
**ch_0 : <yep>**
ch_1 : especially in like Western societies, have you, have you heard of something called the american dream,
ch_0 : <Yeah> I heard that.
ch_1 : it's I guess it's the same thing though because I think we
**ch_0 : That**
ch_1 : we try and chase this idea of what is going to make us happy. So for example the american dream I guess is owning your own house, having a big plot of land <um> achieving like independence, but in reality sometimes trying to get there is almost impossible for a lot of people. So and that pursuit makes us unhappy. The act of trying to get there makes us unhappy.
ch_0 : <yeah> Don't you feel like since you told me your kind of thing with her back? <Yeah>
**ch_1 : <Um>**
ch_0 : So because it is gold, two Other men. Hillary or you should think of some kind you contain yourself like thinking
ch_1 : <mm> <Yeah> I think you should always set goals that are realistic because I think if you set a goal that is unachievable it is only going to make you unhappy when you simply can't achieve it, if that makes sense. So if I if I set myself a goal and I say I'm going to become president of the United States, I think that goal, whilst it could technically be achievable, it's not realistic in that I'm never going to be President of the United States. <Um> and it's a goal that's too difficult to achieve for me I think so I think goal setting is important but I think
**ch_0 : I think**
ch_1 : as long as those goals are realistic and not kind of unachievable than I think they could be useful and they could bring you happiness when you achieve goals that are realistic, but
**ch_0 : <oh>**
ch_1 : but when you put when you give yourself a target that's not achievable and then you don't achieve it that makes you unhappy.
ch_0 : so your goal is
**ch_1 : That's mine.**
**ch_0 : to the ball.**
ch_1 : I think the goals that I've set myself for my career I think are achievable. I hope if I work hard enough. But <um>
ch_0 : <Yeah> <yeah> compared to pregnant.
ch_1 : they are. <Yeah> exactly, that's my thought process anyway.
**ch_0 : Okay,**
ch_1 : But <yeah> no it's it's interesting, it's like, I don't know, it's so it's such a difficult time when you're at college because I don't think you've really found who you are yet. So you don't really know much about yourself, You don't really know much about what job you want to be doing, how you want to spend your life. And it's like so in english you would call it a crossroads.
**ch_0 : correct.**
ch_1 : So <yeah> when you're when you're in so for example you're on the road and there's another road and you don't know which turn to take,
**ch_0 : Like**
ch_1 : it's your at that point and I guess so am I about, I don't know, you just got to make sure that you make the right decision for you.
ch_0 : <yeah> Right. <Yeah> <Um> I should take a break. <Yeah> <Yeah>
ch_1 : <Yeah> I think so. Just work, work out what you want to do because before I went to college I had a year off from studying Sweet. Okay, it's called a gap here, I took a gap here and then just decided whether I wanted to become a lawyer or
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : go and do history at university or what I wanted to do and in that year I kind of decided what I wanted to do with my career and stuff like that. So <yeah> a bit of time off might help you out from deciding what you actually want to do. <Mhm> So <uh> well feedback wise, I'll give you some, I'll give you some feedback in the documents, I'll give you some specific grammatical feedback in the dark,
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : but I think it was it was quite nice to have a discussion. I thought today
**ch_0 : <Yeah> Right,**
ch_1 : such an interesting topic, like it's obviously very important for us, especially a philosophy student, this sort of stuff should be
**ch_0 : because**
ch_1 : in english, we say right up your alley or your bread and butter, so it means it's suited to you, you're good at it,
**ch_0 : <oh> thank you.**
ch_1 : so you're welcome. But <yeah> I think just trying to be concise if you can, so in some of your answers it was quite they were quite long answers, but there was quite a lot of repetition and I think as the listener, it was quite difficult to understand at times because you're just you're repeating yourself a little bit and it was quite hard to kind of,
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I think sometimes you make a point and then you'd say it again in different words and then I kind of get confused. <Um> but I could, I think generally I can work out what you're saying and grammatically there's just a few things that we could change. So, so for example,
**ch_0 : is that**
ch_1 : I just trying to focus on it right now, maybe I am just trying to focus on it right now, so making sure that you get articles and stuff.
**ch_0 : okay?**
ch_1 : <Uh> So I am, I used to like to draw that's fine.
**ch_0 : Right,**
ch_1 : <Um> there's another, I just want to find an example <uh> <yeah> I think it's just like also awkward phrasing as well, so there's a few things at times, it's like my age is increasing, that doesn't quite make, it makes sense, but you're better off saying something like as I've got older or as I've matured or something like that, so there's a few phrases where literally it makes sense but it's better to kind of use a more native phrase, so like as I got older
**ch_0 : but**
ch_1 : that sort of stuff and that just comes from practice, so learning these places and then putting them into practice rather than,
**ch_0 : okay.**
ch_1 : so I know when you're speaking another language it's kind of an equation in your head and you're thinking right, how can I say this with all the english knowledge, I know, how can I put it all together,
**ch_0 : Right, thank you.**
ch_1 : but sometimes you have to kind of try and turn it off and just have a phrase for it instead.
**ch_0 : Good night.**
**ch_1 : So <yeah>**
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : I'm going to give you some stuff in the feedback document about that because I would be quite useful. <Uh>
ch_0 : thank you for the march
ch_1 : <Yeah> and I think
**ch_0 : Yes**
ch_1 : if you, like I said, I feel wondering like that's quite a,
**ch_0 : benefit.**
ch_1 : I think if you're saying something like that, you need to kind of explain a little bit more what you mean by that, so just adding a bit of detail as well, so
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : making sure that you kind of add appropriate detail and where to add it. So for example I feel wondering could be I haven't found the right path in life yet. I feel as though I'm kind of without a purpose you could say. So it's kind of blaming yourself a little bit more when you make those kind of more complex points.
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : <Um> <Yeah> and I think that is probably about it just a few years, like coherency things, so like using natural phrase and that will make it sound more coherent to like the english listener for sure. But have you got any questions before we end, before we finish,
ch_0 : No, no, actually it was great to me. What's your point now is all because of korean mentality? <Yeah>
**ch_1 : you know? <Yeah>**
ch_0 : <Oh> this is about all that.
ch_1 : <Yeah> <Yeah> I mean a lot of the mistakes you make are very common to korean speakers of english and I well I've been doing this tutoring, I often see people making the same mistakes and it's just something that's very common when you translate korean to english in your head for sure. <Yeah> it's just a very common mistake and I'll go through all of them, point them out in the feedback document and just have a read through that afterwards.
**ch_0 : Right,**
ch_1 : Apart from that is what I find it really interesting. Always like having philosophical talks. It's always interesting to see what other people think and
**ch_0 : okay,**
ch_1 : how other people kind of approach these questions for sure. Thank you very much. Anyway, thank you very much for discussion.
ch_0 : okay, thank you very much.
ch_1 : Hope that I hope that's useful.
**ch_0 : <Yeah> it was.**
**ch_1 : Good**
**ch_0 : Bye.**
