**ch_1 : <Mhm> Why?**
ch_0 : <Um> I make a lot of <um> excuses
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : the <um> post spring it's hard to pronounce but three I mean the least.
ch_1 : Procrastinating. Procrastinating. <Yeah> <Mhm>
ch_0 : <Yeah> and and since I live in the island and then
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : that also means there are only a few <um> bossy ladies two
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : enjoy, I mean not
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : to launch something or to spend your time more efficiently.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <Oh> come. <Mhm> What about what about the golfing that you had started? What about your golfing classes?
ch_0 : I know I I take a lot of nice taste. Not alone.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : I take all questions and the partner training
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : and also**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : I joined a book club.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Yeah> How's that going?
ch_0 : <Um> It's, it is <um> because it's vacation season so it temporarily stopped
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but they assume we will start the clock
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <um> registered as the vacations interest
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and but still I think I want to belong something more outside from gulping or exercising, it's like I want to use the brain more not I thought anymore.
ch_1 : <mm> I don't know. Okay,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : okay, interesting. Like what?
ch_0 : <Um> noon to be aiming or being a better english speaker,
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : my mom to be here <um>
**ch_1 : <mm>**
ch_0 : Their english native speaker, there's mean that <oh> your english is impeccable.
**ch_1 : <mm> <hmm>**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : Fair enough, fair enough. Don't stop on your mind to my mind. <Um> Right, interesting. Okay. Have you tried any other tutors lately? Well, how's that going?
**ch_0 : I**
ch_1 : Have you tried anyone else?
ch_0 : I tried to more than two <ah> teachers,
ch_1 : <Mhm> Was that recent?
ch_0 : that's it. This thing around the two weeks.
ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm> A few weeks ago, a few weeks ago I would say every week just try a new person. See if you can find someone that I want you to tell me because I found a great tutor, someone I really like working with
**ch_0 : Yes,**
ch_1 : and then I can say great. Now you can now you can have two lessons a week, right? And then maybe you find another one and then each of us teaches you like in a different way and a different style and then you get three times as much of a challenge. Right? So that would be really good. So keep going till you can eventually find that one person. Right, But really really nice, you know, thanks for sharing that answer. So just read this out for me and then let's discuss. <Yeah>
ch_0 : I think I need to be more productive these days because speaking personally the more productive I am the better I feel. I don't think I'm spending my time with patiently nowadays. So for example I come up with a lot of excuses and so progress.
ch_1 : Go back, go back to <Yeah> no worries.
ch_0 : <Yeah> progress teenage all the time and that since I live on island,
**ch_1 : There we go.**
ch_0 : there's limited number of possibilities for me to spend my time in a productive way since it's the school holiday season, the book club has been suspended for a while but we'll resume at the end of the holidays but that being said I want to do something a party from learning both and going to the book club especially something that helps me develop my mind instead of just my body.
**ch_1 : Makes sense.**
**ch_0 : Okay.**
ch_1 : Good. <Yeah> There we go. Alright. Nice one. questions.
ch_0 : <Um> <Oh> suspended before. Yes.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Mhm> I can use when I speak casually. Right,
ch_1 : <Yeah> so it's been suspended for a while. <Yeah> <Yeah> <Yeah> exactly. Right so for example even example right <um> called off called off suspended stopped <um> <Yeah> you can definitely use any of those so for example <um> you know okay so for example you know sometimes when gyms will give you an option to suspend your membership right? They'll say okay if you you don't want to come for three months that's okay. You can suspend your membership and you can resume it when you come back right? So it's like the same way it's just <yeah> it just means you know stop it for a while and then when you resume it you just started again and <yeah> you can absolutely use it in a casual you know <um> scenario as well. Does that make sense?
**ch_0 : Thanks. Thanks.**
ch_1 : Good one, anything else?
**ch_0 : <Um> speaking personally.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> You want to do that? Do that one again?
ch_0 : You didn't <oh> speaking personally. Can I use it personally speaking to?
ch_1 : <Oh> <yeah> I think actually that might be personally speaking versus versus let's see let's see what the dictionary recommends and we'll just go with that <um> President president speaking personally personally speaking personally speaking? Speaking present actually <yeah> you're right on this one. So personally speaking should be what we're saying anyway so there we go. <Um> let's just change that because personally speaking speaking person. <Yeah> Alright anything else?
**ch_0 : <Um>**
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
**ch_0 : I'm good too.**
**ch_1 : Yes.**
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : <Mhm> Alrighty well let's start with the actually I want to start by giving you a movie recommendation that I've just watched That's just come out on netflix And it's a really good one and it's called the talented mr Ripley and it's a period movie so it's set in Italy in the 19 late 19 fifties and it's got an amazing plot and young matt Damon jude law and Gwyneth Paltrow and it's a movie I watched last night and I really enjoyed it and it's got some nice some nice english in there as well because they're supposed to be very fancy people. So
**ch_0 : <mhm>**
ch_1 : I would recommend watching it
ch_0 : I've watched the state.
ch_1 : stepfather. You watched it? Okay when's the last time you watched it?
ch_0 : <Mhm> I think this is
**ch_1 : Okay fair enough.**
**ch_0 : <mm>**
ch_1 : <Yeah> it's a really interesting plot isn't it? And it's apparently <yeah> it's based on books
**ch_0 : Yes. <Uh> <huh>**
ch_1 : and there's like five books but only one movie so and there you go. <Um> Do you think that the main actor is a psychopath.
**ch_0 : Yes, I**
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : I think he is
**ch_1 : <yeah>**
ch_0 : and was so creepy two.
ch_1 : <Yeah> I know. Right.
**ch_0 : He's**
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : but it was very interesting to a C
**ch_1 : <mm>**
**ch_0 : attains his feelings.**
ch_1 : <Mhm> Exactly. He just has no conscience.
**ch_0 : <Mhm> <mhm>**
ch_1 : It's kind of amazing
**ch_0 : Yes,**
ch_1 : actually. Maybe the second question I can just ask you about the movie but <um> let's let's start with the pronunciation section So can you pronounce these two words for me?
**ch_0 : nausea**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : conscience.**
ch_1 : There we go. So this is pronounced nausea. Sina zia and then the next word you pronounce it right so that's not sh is right
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : let me just double check this one as well I think you're getting the british pronunciation here aren't we? <Yeah> <Um> Let's make sure we're doing it. Right <yeah> <Yeah> There we go. <Mhm> Nausea and Let's get the American one. <Oh> wait I think you're right on this because the american pronunciation right? Nausea. <Yeah> <Yeah> that's fine then. <Um> Disregard I was teaching the british pronunciation. Yours is fine as well. <Yeah> <Uh> nausea, nausea is perfect. <Um> Can you pronounce the next word? Let's let's break this one up. <Yeah> It's actually not so hard when you break it up. Right bro.
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
**ch_1 : Price.**
**ch_0 : rest**
**ch_1 : Nice.**
ch_0 : no throw chris nick Pro mist in eight
ch_1 : There we go. There we go. One more time.
ch_0 : rock rest in it.
ch_1 : There we go. And then just say this one for me as well. <Yeah>
**ch_0 : Procrastination.**
ch_1 : There we go. So it's the same thing right? Except what are we doing at the end? We're just making it to nation. Right? Procrastination
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : good. Alright let's look at some grammar so go up for me and tell me why wouldn't this work?
ch_0 : <mhm> My daughter is sick now
ch_1 : Lord a second now. Nowadays my daughter is sick. My daughter is sick at the moment. <Um> See here's the thing. <Um> My daughter is sick now if I was if you were to tell me that right it would just mean. Okay so when would I say my father was sick now. Right. <Um> <Mhm> So firstly if you want to but not now at the beginning right now that that would mean you know now that this has happened, you're going to tell me something else. So for example now that I'm moving I've sold my table. Right? So <um> that and so if you were to say for example, now that my daughter is sick, I can't go outside, right, that would make sense, right? But but but it doesn't make sense. Just leave it now that I'm moving full stop or now that my daughter is sick. <Yeah> that doesn't make a lot of sense now, if you were to put now at the end, right, my daughter's sick now, it's like saying right now, right? But what you're trying to tell me is that she's she's been sick for a while, right? So you're not trying to tell me that she's sick right now at this moment, right? <Um> at the moment, why wouldn't we want to say now versus at the moment, let me try, let me try and figure out from a medical perspective this rather seditious is at present at present, I spend his brother at present. That was a different meaning from now on. There we go now. Okay, okay. <Yeah> exactly, so now means at this very second at the moment implies a longer period of time, which includes the present, but may include for example, you know, 23 days In the past in 2-3 days in the future or maybe even a week. Right? So what I would suggest you say is my daughter is sick at the moment because even though at the moment means right now, it also means period of time in the past, period of time in the future now, it's just right now makes sense.
**ch_0 : makes sense.**
ch_1 : <Yeah> Let's make a little note there as well. So at the moment implies no. And a longer time people, <mm> that means right now. But also two days in the past two days in the future,
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : right? Something like that makes sense.
**ch_0 : The expense**
ch_1 : Okay, fix this for me.
ch_0 : hey, when you're swimming,
**ch_1 : They went swimming,**
**ch_0 : hey, stay away.**
ch_1 : right? If you said they went to swimming, right, then I would assume that you're talking about swimming classes or something, right? If you said they went to swim, right, that would still be okay. You could also say they went for a swim. Right? Make sense?
**ch_0 : Listen,**
ch_1 : That that's why she had a fever. Does she still have the fever?
ch_0 : yes, she is. She's having a flavor.
ch_1 : You were explaining to me how she got it? Right? So that's why she got a fever. Right?
ch_0 : If you're donald Catherine
ch_1 : But you can also say yes, that's why she has a fever now, right? <Um> or that's why she has a fever at the moment. <Yeah> that's why she got a fever. That's why she has a fever. <Yeah> Makes sense.
**ch_0 : makes sense**
ch_1 : Whose brain are we talking about?
**ch_0 : vibrant.**
ch_1 : Here we go. Right, so make sense
ch_0 : I want to use my brain office
ch_1 : in the same time,
ch_0 : at the same time.
ch_1 : it's good since I live in the island
ch_0 : Thanks. Artie leave in Ireland
**ch_1 : on an island,**
**ch_0 : on Ireland**
ch_1 : we live in an island. Right? So for example, you could say, okay, So this is interesting, right? Because generally we wouldn't say, you know, I live on Australia. That wouldn't make any sense, right? But if I would say if I said I live on an island called Australia that works. So when we're talking about an island we say we live on an island. But otherwise when we're just talking about countries we say, you know, I live in blah blah blah. I live in blah blah blah. So even if you gave me the name of the city that you live in, you would say in. Right? So whatever the name of the city is, you would say I live in j ju but you would say I live on an island named j ju Right? That makes sense.
**ch_0 : yes.**
ch_1 : <Yeah> that's for me, right? As for me as for me is generally used when you're comparing yourself with what other people you know do, right? So for example <um> you know <um> everyone in my family really likes eating spicy food but as for me I I prefer milder foods, right? So that would make sense. Right? But over here, what you're trying to tell me more is you
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : just you right? You're not really comparing yourself with other people. Right? Right. So in this case it would just make sense to say personally speaking, right? Just just there's no comparison with anyone else here, is there? So as for me is generally used bearing what we you think field with others <um> actions, thoughts, feelings, right? That's ever. Alright. Makes sense.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : Good one. All right. So let's move on. Why don't you briefly try to summarize the plot of <um> the movie for me. The talented Mr Ripley briefly summarize the plot. So just give me and this is a bit of a challenge right? Why am I asking to do this? Because I'm asking you to explain a narrative, condense it and also explain it in a way that makes sense. So give me a summary of what the movie is about. This would be interesting.
ch_0 : <Um> Thanks. <Um> the movie is about a man is very pretty,
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : but very intelligent. So he eating, he doesn't use his talent for <oh> for of good things. He news.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : Okay. We're taking a dentist from others.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : Not just like they were people he admired so much
**ch_1 : Okay.**
ch_0 : for the week people and so neat
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : at one man And he really wanted to get along with him 1st.
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : But <um> I think that doesn't work as he expected
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : so he thought more
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : so he wanted to tape his life. All right.
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : He was so useless.
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : <Um> When he wanted to take what he wants.
ch_1 : <Mhm> I'm just saying.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : And what do you think the main No that's good. So what what do you think the main takeaway of the movie is? What do you think the main message that do you think that do you think there is a message in the movie? And if there is then what do you think the message is?
**ch_0 : Anything**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : Thanks we**
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : or. <Mhm> Are ingredient penalty, penalty, penalty and greed. Greed.
**ch_1 : <Mhm> <Mhm>**
ch_0 : Okay. <Mhm> Someone's light.
ch_1 : <Mhm> No, it's good. That's good. There we go. I liked it. <Um> Alright, read this out for me and then let's discuss.
ch_0 : The movie is about a man who is extremely grating but also very intelligent. He doesn't utilize his talent for good but rather to exploit others. He admires with people the most, especially one man who he gets obsessed to it. But things don't turn out as he expects. And tom's great increases more and more. Tom eventually kills the man he's obsessed with and starts impressed, Impersonating him. I think the main message of the movie is that vanity and greed can bring someone's life
ch_1 : Make sense. There we go. <Um> questions
**ch_0 : <um> utilize**
ch_1 : Sure. <Yeah> <Mhm> 90 ounce
ch_0 : I thought for good things forever.
**ch_1 : sorry**
ch_0 : For good means forever.
ch_1 : for good. <Oh> <yeah> it means <yeah> it does mean forever. Very good. <Um> It also means, so for example if you use your powers for good or for evil Right. That means like
**ch_0 : <Mhm>**
ch_1 : you do it for like a good purpose or a bad purpose right? <Um> <Yeah> it does actually mean forever as well. There's multiple meanings of for good, we can discuss that. Sure. Anything else?
**ch_0 : White**
ch_1 : <Mhm> exploit anything else
**ch_0 : Impersonating.**
ch_1 : impersonate, impersonation, impersonation. Let's just do both of them and then let's do for good as well already. And
**ch_0 : Let's see.**
ch_1 : let's go with some pronunciation. Can you pronounce this word for me? I'm kind of hearing ruin. Sorry I'm hearing almost like ruin. Like
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : like if I can eat but I want to hear it ruin ruin right,
**ch_0 : Right. Really?**
**ch_1 : ruin ruin.**
**ch_0 : But you went.**
ch_1 : <Yeah> almost like a. U. Sound ruin.
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : <Yeah> So like you're ruined right? The ruins of that. So it's almost like a. U. Sound. It's not really a nice sound at all.

**ch_0 : You won't**
ch_1 : It just tends to be more like ruin instead of ruin. Right? See Alice ist keep that in mind. All right. <Um> Let's kick off with the words and expressions. Let's start with utilize what does it mean to utilize something? What do you think it means?
ch_0 : something gator to the tent. I can do.
ch_1 : No that's good. That's good. That's good. So when we utilize something right? We make effective use of it. We actually use it. <Um> We we make use of it to like a practical to make use of something. Exactly to make use of that. I think that's the best one to <yeah> to make use of something is to utilize it? Right. Especially practical use of it? Right. To make use of something? <Um> So for example, <um> Right. So for example, right at my company we have something called a utilization rate and that's just the amount of time that we're working on client projects and making money. So that's the amount of times that a company is utilizing us, right, literally. So they're making use of us to make money. Right? And <um> or how about this? Let's let's get some let's get some more examples that are a bit simpler. Right? <Um> <Yeah> Okay. Exactly. So vitamin C. Right. Why do we use vitamin C? Why do we take vitamin C? Because vitamin C helps our body utilize the iron in our diet. Right. So vitamin C helps our body to actually use the iron so that we can have strong bones and things like that. Right. <Um> Or how about this? So <um> I have good internet. I just need to utilize it better. Right? So that would mean that I have good internet but I'm not using it properly. Right. I'm not using it practically to the best extent. To the to the greatest extent. Right. First extent, let's get let's get some more let's get some Mcmillan sentences <um> utilize american spelling. <Um> Right. <Yeah> This room is used main, sorry, this room is mainly utilized for training purposes. Right. That would mean that it's mainly used for training purposes. Right? <Um> Exactly. So, <um> what do you what do usually utilize? Right. So, <um> what, what, what teaching materials do you utilize while instructing your students? Right. So what teaching materials do you use? Do you make use of? Right. Which which materials do you make use of when teaching your students? Right. Right. So for example, I utilize this style. Right? With the bar phrase answers and and the new words and expressions pronunciation. I'm making use of this style, right? I'm using it, right? I'm using it and I'm using it in a practical way. Right? So I'm using it and I'm using it in. And what do we, what do I mean by a practical way? In a in the way that it's designed for, Right to actually achieve something. Right, So I'm using it and I'm getting something out of it, which is practical skills, practical <um> <yeah> in an effective way to make use of something in an effective way. Give me an example sentence of using utilized, utilize utilize in a center?
**ch_0 : <Um>**
**ch_1 : <Yeah>**
ch_0 : My husband bought me a gold driver
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
ch_0 : and the driver is supposed to utilize
**ch_1 : <Mhm>**
**ch_0 : to further distance.**
ch_1 : Okay, so you're talking about a golf club. Right, Okay. Exactly. Exactly. The golf club is meant to be utilized, right? Is meant to be utilized? Is can be utilized to, so it's meant to be utilized for longer shots? Right? Why is it changing my sponsor? <Um> utilized for whatever longer shots. Right? Or you can say, <um> you know, I can utilize the golf club for longer shots,
**ch_0 : Yes.**
ch_1 : right? So you can make use of it, right? You can use it effectively for longer shots. Right. Makes sense.
**ch_0 : Thanks.**
ch_1 : Good one exploit. What does it mean to exploit someone or something? What do you think?
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : So there's different meanings to exploit? Right, exploit can mean when we make full use of something to get the full benefit from something, right? So that's not a negative meaning, right? So for example, zoom zoom exploited the pandemic to grow as fast as it could, right? So they made full use of the they got the full benefit from that, right? But generally when we use exploit, we are talking about a situation in which the way that we've done something, it's kind of unfair to someone or something, right? So to let's say to make use of a situation or someone right? In an unfair and devious kind of way? Right? Selfishly an unfair, selfish way. Right? So for example, <um> he exploits his parents. <Um> he exploits his parents <um> to get as much money as possible, right? Or <um> or how about this? <Um> The doctor exploited his patients trust in him and did a lot of <um> surgeries which were not needed, right? Performed law of surgeries that weren't needed right? <Um> in Australia there's a problem with <um> with the exploitation of <um> immigrants in restaurants, right? So a lot of restaurant owners exploit them and pay them pay them less than they should be. Right. Give me a sentence for exploit exploitation, exploited.

ch_1 : <Mhm> So politicians exploit people in Korea or taxpayers? <Um> <um> <Yeah> Exactly. <Um> Taxpayers lots to say <um> <Mhm> By imposing unfair taxes. Right? Does that make sense?
**ch_0 : and**
ch_1 : Good one. So you understand what they're doing right there there using the situation in an unfair and in a selfish way? Right. Good. All right. Now let's get <um> let's get the meaning of impersonate now, I want you to just pronounce this word for me.
**ch_0 : impersonal**
ch_1 : Good. And this one
**ch_0 : impersonation**
ch_1 : impersonation there we go, impersonate an impersonation, right? What do you mean to impersonate someone? You thought you might have heard this word before?
**ch_0 : copy.**
ch_1 : Exactly. Right. So literally it means mimic or imitate, right? But it's like when you pretend to be someone for comedy, right? So for entertainment or as as in the case of Ripley right, fraud. Right? So an impersonation can just be me doing someone's voice, right? Like pretending to be someone, right? But impersonation can also be me stealing someone's identity, right? And pretending to be that person. Right? So in Ripley's case, right? He was Impersonating dickie, right? He was pretending to be him for
**ch_0 : <Yeah>**
ch_1 : illegal reasons, Right? So that's basically fraud, right? So let me give you an example, right? <Um> Impersonating a police officer is a serious crime in Australia, right? So pretending to be a cop. Right? Right. <Um> or or how about this? You might have seen that documentary? Tinder swindler, right? That guy on Tinder who was pretending to be a really rich guy right? In the son of this diamond diamond menu sort of like person in Israel. Right? So he was Impersonating that guy, right? He was he was he was it was just an impersonation, right? He was Impersonating <um> that diamond billionaire's son, right? But I could also say for example, <um> who's a famous comedian? So <um> one of my favorite comedians, british comedians. Catherine date, right? She's known for her impersonations. So she does accents from different countries and different different people, right? This is a little bit harder to make a sentence of but give me a sentence.
ch_0 : <Um> You want to impersonate someone you should be careful because it could be
ch_1 : There we go. <Yeah> <Yeah> If you impersonate someone, if you impersonate someone for a laugh, right? Or as a joke, you should be careful knocked you offend them.
**ch_0 : and**
ch_1 : Right, accidentally offend them. Good makes sense. Good one. That's a really really good point. Exactly. Right. Nice. So what does four good mean for good means forever?
**ch_0 : <yeah>**
ch_1 : Right. It also means <um> to do without possibility of change. Yes. This forever. Forever. For better. For better that we offer better for better something for the good off. <Yeah> Exactly. Okay. So that's the other meaning is <um> for the good <um> So if you do something for good, right? It means that you're doing it for a positive benefit, right? If you do something for evil, right? Or for an underhanded purpose or for an illicit purpose or for an illegal purpose, then that's obviously not good, right? Is the opposite for good, Right? <Um> Usually we use this for good, he could use this when we talk about someone's ability, right? And <um> they could they could take a bath and they could use it for good or for evil, That's how we usually say it. Right? So <um> <yeah> for a positive, positive for positive benefit, right? For positive. <Um> So for example, <um> you know, in superhero movies, you often hear, you know, he uses his powers for good, right? Not for evil, right? Or something like that, right? So usually it's like that for the <um> that's literally all it is, but that's a very rare use of it compared to the first one, which for good just means forever, right? So in this one case we're talking about someone who is very talented, you could use his abilities in either case, right? For evil? Right? So for bad purposes or for good, positive, you know benefit and he decided to use it for evil and not for good, does it make sense?
**ch_0 : they say**
ch_1 : Good? Alright, and just fix this grammar for me blah blah admire so much for the rich people.
ch_0 : admire rich people a lot.
ch_1 : Exactly, exactly. He so we're talking about tom right so admires rich people tom Ripley. My tom Ripley advised rich people a lot or admires admires. That makes sense. Clear
