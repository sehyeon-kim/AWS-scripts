ch_1 : Evan, my man, how are you? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello. There we go, balls away chairs in.
Good to see you
hazard So so very, very shortly and will be in the same time zone? I'm not sure if I told you but I'm gonna be in I'm gonna be in Seoul and About about about a month I'm leaving on the 31st and then I'll be I'll be in Seoul on the 1st, 1 August so very shortly. Well we'll be we'll be a bit more manageable than than this. Because what what what's the I mean you're you're in you're more you're you're Sydney. Right, so that's that's that's east. I don't know if this is at the same time zone as soul? You got to check that Sydney whatever it is, it'll be closer. you're only one hour ahead. So closer than right now I think you're probably like</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Right now it's a 802 PM.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : never mind. So you only eight hours ahead? I misjudged that. Okay, that makes I guess that makes sense.
Anyway, I'll be one hour not not eight. So that counts for something but
anyway. How have you been?
Good. That's good to hear.
Are you are you is a school over for you or you on summer.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : It's school holidays now.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do? What are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So we have junior Australian floorboard open
which is like states global.
F. F. L. O. R. Floor ball.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : you mentioned this last time? I know. But Okay. Right. The sticks. Okay. So you're you're gonna play in the</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : We're already playing now.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : wow. Okay, great. That's awesome. And are you like, what what position do you play?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I play santa which is forward.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, okay, nice, nice. how competitive does it get people get like really mad if they don't get the ball or is it like hockey or you people get beat up and stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Well they don't get beat up but like People get hot faced like really and sometimes angry and we be Queensland two times now. So like
the queen, the Queensland's coaches is like really upset.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I imagine, I imagine, I imagine so. well maybe it's the coach you have to be on the lookout for make sure the coach isn't bringing anything illicit into the, into the room
because you don't know, you really never know. Cool. Okay, so floor ball, anything anything else? Now that it's like negative in the negatives, the summary negatives in Australia, What are you what are you up to? You got to go skiing?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I'm gonna go camping maybe.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : my goodness. In this what what what temperature is it outside right now?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : It's I'm not sure we can. Right. 16 degrees.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : 16. Okay, nice, roasty, toasty, roasted toast to july, Nice. I'm actually kind of impressed. 16 is 16 seems rather hot for
for for Australia july but but maybe it'll I don't know, do you think you think it's gonna stay that way for long or?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I don't think because some now these days it's sometimes it's starting to Sprinkle.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : okay, like snow Sprinkle or rain? Sprinkle</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Got it Ryan Sprinkle.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, alright, it's marginally better, marginally better. Okay, well keep me posted, keep posting your floor ball activities and you know that goes
today we're talking about kombucha though with, with what is your interest in
in this fizzy drink? What with, what do you like? What?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : It's because my mom makes it at home.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : no, she doesn't really. This article says you shouldn't make it at home but she does. Okay so explain.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So we have this friend
and they may come which of themselves as well.
And then to make kombucha and you need the Scobie.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : You need to what?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Like the Scobie which is the, it says it mentions this in the insight</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : the Scooby. sorry you're right the acronym. Right I was I thought you was something else. Okay. Right</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : that and we don't have any. So we borrowed some from them
and we could make our own,</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : how how how how how easy is Scobee to come by? Is it is it a</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : well if you just get the temperature right? The sugar amount right? You it's it will start forming a layer of Scobie.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay And if you so okay and how how much do you need is it a small amount or what are we talking?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Well so scope is a living organism. So it grows over time.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay so only a small amount and then you can and then you can just sort of leave it.
Gotcha. Gotcha interesting. And so so okay so how much how much have you drunk? That's been homemade?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : around two. So we have these two big jugs of that holds Malcolm butcher
And it's around 200 ml.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : 200 mL. Okay. goodness me two liters
at any given moment you have two leaders of kombucha at the house.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : we drink a lot of it.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : well it does say it's it's probiotic right so I met
but it's also got I mean how much alcohol do you have in there? What's the alcoholic content?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : It's less than 0.5%.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Okay. Okay so not not enough to get you drunk and
a drunk minor Evan. that's goodness like the
wow. I mean is there are there the laws in Australia there must be more relaxed than in the U. S. You don't have I mean what's the legal drinking age?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I think it's adulthood which is 18.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. it is okay I was about to say in most countries it's like 16 and then you can But no one obeys that, right? If it's 16, you end up doing it at 11, so probably your age.
But I don't think it's a good idea. I'm not I'm not endorsing that at all and Ringel does not either. So as as as noted at the bottom of the the insight.
So anyway Cool. Did you notice the difference between the kombucha that your mom makes in the kombucha you find in stores? Are you allowed to drink kombucha from stores? Or is there an embargo on that? Is there a household embargo on a store bought kombucha?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : so what? We can drink kombucha from the stores, but we don't really do that anymore since we have our own.
And I probably prefer prefer the homemade ones.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Okay. Okay, naturally. Are you under duress right now and saying that?
Is there is your mom, is mom over your shoulder? Okay. Alright. Alright. Alright.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : No. I just like it.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Okay, suspicious. But I'll accept, I'll accept
Cool. What do you like most about the drinks? Just kinda give me some highlights.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Probably because it gives you the feeling that after your for example after a day of work you drink com butcher it refreshes you and like start you up again</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Sure. Sure. So one could say, I'm sure you you know this word? But what you're essentially saying is, you know, it's
revitalizes, have you seen, revitalizes this word?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Like a real five. She kind of</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Exactly. Exactly. This is vitality life, right? Their livelihood sort of, it's an expression of, to what extent you alive, right? So it revitalizes the drinker right? Or the consumer? Probably it's better better way to put that good. Okay. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : it's just it's a good instead of like coke and soda, it's a good replacement.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : because it's still fizzy, right? It still kind of has that fizzy taste to it? But it's it's just not.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : it has a lot less sugar.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I imagine so. I imagine so If it's rights ferment God the amount of sugar in in coke just boggles the mind I mean but even they do have the zero sugar solution but I'm not even sure like what the
like how it still tastes the same, you know like.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : this is this like something in in it like it's probably more has probably more chemicals in it than the normal one.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : that or stevia. I know Stevie is a popular a popular sugar cane sugar replacement. So
there's always sorry not cane sugar but processed sugar replacement. So I don't know maybe maybe that's maybe that's what they use but I've just known them to taste the same so it's unusual to me Anyway I think we discussed this before but talk about some of your favorite fermented items. Doesn't matter if it's like kombucha. Right, just talk to me about generally. What kind of what kind of fermented foods you like?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : My favorite fermented food is probably kimchi</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Probably not definitely. And why why why kimchi?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : because the same as my mom makes it at home as well,</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : It's really interesting. Your sister, your sister told me that your family is from china, correct.
But kimchi is like more of a korean dish.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So what we eat at home is more like a multicultural,</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : no that's that's that's totally fair. I'm just I was just I was just wondering. Okay cool cool that's great. So What what do you put in the in the kimchi,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : so there's there's vegetables, there's ginger. There's also a little bit of chili and there's also salt and fish sauce.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : wow. Alright. Salt and fish sauce?
What what what kind of fish did you you make the sauce yourself or do you just take that from from the store?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : we we buy from the store</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Okay. Okay. And then. And then how long do you have to ferment that for?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : probably around a week.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. So where do you leave it? You just you put it in
covered like where do you where do you ferment the food?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : we like to leave it out like in the cupboard where there's nice environment.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Okay. How do you make sure that there's no mold that grows on it? Like what what's the what's the deal there? I'm I'm not a chemist. But what what's the</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Well we've never had the issue of mold at our family, so we don't really worry about it that much. So we just make it the way that we do</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : what's the. Okay I'm thinking maybe it's the some I don't know. Maybe it's the maybe
or the salt that does it. I don't know but but there must be a reason why there's no there's no there's no kind of like
bacteria that grows on it. Okay cool. Right. What other kimchi, what do you what do you make out of kimchi? Besides just the the the solution like what can you do with that?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Or you can make a lot of things such as like kimchi pancakes, which I have never tried. But my mom wants to make it at some point. And also kimchi fried rice</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : That last one I'm most familiar with but I'm not familiar. I'm also familiar with kimchi fried rice and also kimchi pancakes but but they're definitely rarer than than what what I'm used to.
Cool. Cool. What what is your favorite option of between between kimchi fried rice and kimchi stew. What do you prefer?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Right. Probably the kimchi fried rice.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : The student I mean even the word stew just sounds awful, doesn't it stew?
It could be anything? I feel like people mostly use that in a negative context nowadays and said like you're</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : When they like make write a book, they use like stew and then they put all sorts of stuff inside.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Exactly. Exactly. I know. I know people even believe in column
people even call like cities like, like stews sometimes because all the people that are in it, like they just call them like a stew of pollution. I don't know. But,
but never has a good connotation. I've never heard anyone say, I love that stew. It's it smells great.
Sounds like so oxymoronic. Anyway.
okay, so continuing with with the, with the kombucha reframe. are are these rumors that kombucha can cure the incurable or is this legit to you?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Right. I think it's pretty, I understand why they think it's it can cure the incurable because com butcher is full of probiotics and it's very good for our digestion, digestion system
and probiotics support healthy body systems from your mouth to your gut.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : And have you felt this to be the police?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : After I eat something that has, I've ate something that's not that good for me. When I drink a com butcher, it makes it helps,
it helps my stomach, like the digestion properly or better.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : as as opposed to what other drinks are there that help you do that? Or is kombucha the sole solution?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I don't really know any other drinks that do that. I mean like the probiotic little like milk like sing. Don't.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : you actually knows they're sometimes they're awful. They're awful tasting.
But so you, you generally like the probiotic.
I'm always scared of the milk one because I, I don't know if I leave it out too long, Like I don't know what's gonna fester inside of it? You know, I might, I might, I might have like an alien that like
grows in my stomach and you know, next thing. I know there's like a whole whole rip through my abs but
that's actually that's probably more of a concern for your assistance and she's working on her, on her abs, on her six pack.
Would want an alien going through that. Okay, so Great. Do you know the process behind probiotics? Like how they work or how they aid digestion?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : What? 70. So probiotics can help control harmful microorganisms, like jams inside your stomach and probiotics age or digestion system and improve nutrient absorbent absorbent absorption.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : And and and like how how do they how do they how do they do that? I don't know. I guess this article didn't really talk much about it anyway, but
I think it's just interesting to to know the processes. It's sort of like never I find it's never good to to think of something as just a magical drink. Right? I think the end of this article, they say it's a fun sparkling elixir, right?
But I think it's sort of dangerous and you just think of something as magic because you don't really know what exactly you're ingesting or you don't care to know because you just think it's perfect. I don't know if, you know, but before four plastics were considered pollution as they are now, right? They were actually considered a miracle substance. No one really bothered to really look into what plastics were, but you can shape it into whatever you want, right? So it's the miracle, the miracle material,
we could essentially do whatever we want with it, it molds to bends to our will, we can make chairs, we can make boxes, we can make probably buildings, I'm sure they probably thought of that too.
and it's, and it can be, it can be soft. It can be a pliant. It can be hard. It can be all these things. but of course what they didn't think it could be was pollution and turns out that plastics are just not biodegradable and that's how we get to be in the situation that we are now. so that's why that's why I say, I think it's always good to be skeptical of these things. Always good to be skeptical period. but
do you like physically go, sorry, go ahead.
What were you saying?
You do never know. That's right. That's right. You never know. And it's good to know. It's good to know. Cool. But you're a curious kid. So I'm sure I have no problem with that. Do you like fizzy drinks generally?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I like fizzy drinks like that. Aren't that fizzy like coke when you drink it
it this is your when you when it goes down your throat, your throat just tingles a lot.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Do you, do you also like spray, is it, what are the popular drinks like in Australia? They, are they the same as the rest of the western world or do you have,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I'm not really sure but that sprites are pretty. That's right coke. Of course. Fanta Gatorade and I forgot the other one. It was like Pepsi. Pepsi</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Gatorade and Pepsi interesting, interesting. between coke and Pepsi. Sorry. I just have to ask this because it's, it's, it's an like interminable conflict in my family. coke versus Pepsi who wins?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I would probably say coke but I dislike both of them.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Good answer? Good answer. That's all I needed to hear. We can continue this lesson now. That's, that's that's settled. I'll tell my mom, dad, she'll be very disappointed, but, but, but the rest of my family will be very happy.
how how often how often do you drink kombucha?
You're joking. Really? So when you say, when you say frequently, you really mean frequently, wow.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So we just go and get some kombucha, come back, get some more.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : And meanwhile she's she's busy fixing up the next batch. That's amazing, wow.
Do you do you think it's like, I don't know after reading this article, do you are you a bit more skeptical about? I'm here you are and there's no reason to be. But are are you are you did you anyway, question why this article was saying that people shouldn't are advised against trying it on their own.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Probably. Maybe if they made it, if they made something and if they made the combo shot and it went really wrong, they will probably say like that document or something maybe.
it could be like it could go, could be a fail
by myself. I would I would probably recommend other people to make it because it's really easy to make.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : It's simple, but then you have to do it right? What what what are the what are the reasons they say? I mean are you are you aware why they say why they advise against trying trying this on your own,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I'm not really sure because it could be Children reading this article
and then they might think they want to make it. I'm not sure.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Sure. Sure. But like what are the cons Right? Like there must be a reason they say that
I mean if it's so basic. Right? Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Maybe that's because there's a small amount of alcohol in it.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : but it seems to mean 3%. I mean
don't tell your mom, but I have something I have something that I got as a birthday gift that's 21, birthday gift, just so we're clear, That's 17%. So I I don't think I don't think 3% is gonna cut it at all and I mean,</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Okay. Yes your point</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : exactly, this is nothing. Right? So maybe, I mean, I'm imagine it's probably the and probably it's the the fermentation process, that's that's but I don't know, this is all speculating</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : gross. Which is the the Scobie looks really gross.
This baby looks like burger,</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : let's like, let's find a wow, I should not have looked that up goodness, you're right. It's wow, that is something this that you write, this does look like, like, like booger. but it comes in a kind of like how to describe that, It's sort of like it's still not.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : it looks like like jelly.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : it's super jolt. There's a word for that by the way you ever curious
use this word, it was like gel, like
or like jelly, jelly, like. But it's just, I mean it's sort of so you take the, I'm guessing for what it looks like is you have a solution and then you let it sit and then you kind of take the top part of it, right? Or or you I don't know, it's sort of like a you're putting in a mason jar, it's like circular, right? It's like a layer, a layer out of, is that what is that what it is?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So it's on, it's, it will just float on top. it's a layer.
but not but if you say Scobie doesn't mean only com butcher.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Right, it can be, it's anything, so so Scobie also that will also be put, is that also the process to make kimchi or what are we talking? Is that, is that the same thing?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So so Scobie stands for a simple colony of bacteria and yeast.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Right. Right, so can you do the same thing with like how do you how do you do your how do you do your your kimchi?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So we let we just let it sit and then it will like I'm not really sure about the fermenting process.
I have to ask my mom about that.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : No, that's fine. That's fine. Just just sort of sort of wondering because it seems to me if it's sort of like sounds
sounds the same. But I mean, there must be something other than just letting it sit that, you know, there's some there needs to be some agent, right?
Not a special agent, right? But something.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : like chemical on the back</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Exactly. Exactly. And that's stored. Right.
Right. Do you think that like, like do you think that these superfoods as they put it right, have have a power that's not explainable by modern medicine? Or does this make you skeptical this claim that they can do things that we can't even fathom.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I think that's just gone way too far
I mean just saying that it can cure things that we can't cure it that can be raised of noble but things that like that's just too far.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Right. Like drinking kombucha can cure cancer, right? Or something like that.
I think, I think, it can be it can be dangerous too, right. If you think about it, if you're if you're you're selling this to someone with actual with, you know, leukemia, right? And you say, well, kombucha can save your life because it's super food. I don't think, you know, stop your chemo, right? And just drink kombucha? I don't know that that's that's a bit,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : wow okay maybe somebody is like allergic to it and then they drink it because they say superfood.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : wow, I hadn't thought about that. That's that's that's that's even gets more intense? You're right. goodness me and I you're learning Scobie and you, wow. I mean, it's like not only is it not only is it gonna like slide down your throat, it's also gonna grow so it's gonna mix with your digestive tract. That is not</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I'm not sure if that will happen because that will that will be like scary something living growing inside your stomach.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : no sorry I I just meant like it's it's a it will interact with with your digestive tract in ways that might not be fun
but I I feel like once it's in your once it's in your large intestine likelihood that it's gonna like be neutralized by your your stomach acids. This is
is so but still
goodness. definitely not. I mean of all the things to be allergic to, I would imagine Scobie is probably not one you want to be actually messing around with people who do have like for example gluten gluten intolerances right? do or can on occasion right, consume gluten
but it does kind of mess with your your well it leads sometimes to nausea and uncomfortable bowel movements. My friends recently had some gluten I don't know if it's not really an allergy but he's intolerant to gluten any, he had some beer which was obviously there there's a there's yeast in there to sort of help the I mean that's just part of the brewing process, right? And he definitely had the next day, he was bedridden essentially the whole time he couldn't you got into bed just to take a shower I think and and and threw up but that was about it. So.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I remember when I was in year three, one of my friends they can't eat gluten at all.
So I bought him something
and I asked the canteen ladies if it had gluten inside and then I said and I was like max
can't you you can't have gluten right? And then he told and then he said
I can just have a little bit is fine and when I gave it to him after he ate it he got really sick</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Well obviously these these kids so the kids you're hanging out with aren't aren't as discerning as you. I love how you're the one that you're the one reminding him of his own predicament of his own allergy and and him telling you to define and then anyone</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : and then he says he's okay with it.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : right and then him getting the one in being the one in trouble. That's that's a you deserve you deserve a nobel peace prize for that. That is that is some serious A serious wow. My goodness.
I feel like you're the you're the most mature, you're you're 11 right
time but in in in in like not in like I don't know I know in Korea they have the okay I had one extra year. You aren't doing that right? You're just going by</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Not just by you.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : okay. by your birthday, wow. I mean you're the most mature nine year old. I know I think I think when I was nine I was I don't know what I was I wasn't thinking about other people's allergies is all I don't even know what I was it's probably
like you probably know I was still I was still sucking on binky is I don't even know anyway that's good, good for you, good for you? Do you have any questions about the article? Was there anything here that any words that that that chemicals used you
and it's okay if not but I'm just wondering if you</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Have a check english.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : they're like symbiotic like Fizzy, I'm sure you know fizzy it's me
easier probiotic. Right? I mean you mentioned probiotics so I imagine that's not an issue.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : No I don't think so.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. And you also know what symbiotic means? Right. Okay.
symbolized. No. So so that that's symbolic. So that's symbolic symbiotic. First like a relationship between two things if they're if they're if they're codependent.
So we can say for example I don't know for example frogs and
that's a bad example. I don't know anything about frogs. Flowers and bees, right? When when bees take the state and and they they they pollinate, right? The flowers. And so the bees get there their honey, right? But they can also but they're also in this at the same time helping flowers pollinate, right?
That's a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : so helping. Like both sides technically.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Or like even like teachers and students, right? You could say, you know</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : for example a student gets good marks and gets and gets and then the teacher maybe get an award for the best class of the year or something.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Exactly. Exactly. Great. It's great. A great analogy. So any kind of relationship where both parties benefit in some way is a symbiotic symbiotic relationship most of the time though. This is like I said before this is for for codependent relationships. So in situations where
those parties rely on one another for some kind of you know, for some kind of livelihood. Right? So that that's why I mentioned the bees and the flowers because I thought that that was probably the most the best way of indicative indicating is that that you know for flowers survival, right? And for be survival as well. They need to exist in this relationship. I don't know that you know teachers necessarily live too, you know get their kids, their students good marks.
