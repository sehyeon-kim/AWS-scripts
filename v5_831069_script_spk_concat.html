<p>ch_1 : Okay. It's no problem at all.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I just this is my form
thanks, it's the first time maybe use Form 2 2. Ringo.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Well, no worries. We'll do our best to make it work and it's no, no big deal that you're late. We can still try to get through as much as we can. My name is Sierra. You might have skimmed through my ringle profile, but I'm a sophomore at the University of michigan and I'm studying psychology and spanish
and right now I'm working as a behavior tech. So I work with Children who have autism spectrum disorder to help work on their skills and behavior. Tell me a little bit about yourself.
It's nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Nice to meet you. I
I'm I previously worked as a construction,
and recently transferred to make a front company and I like it and like what I do. No wonder why.
in almost seven years
well we still love each other so much but don't have any kids yet.
What? Well in fact we as you said it, let's advocates</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : okay. Well, I think that if that's the right decision for you guys. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : and so Thank you. We that's why we recently have been focusing on, you know trying to find some things we can enjoy. It's good.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I love that. Focusing on your guys relationship is always good. I'm so happy for you. Congratulations on seven years of a happy marriage
of course. So we can just get right in sounds like you just want to work on improving your long sentences and your pronunciation and it looks like you already answered some of the things so I can go right into paraphrasing those and then we can talk about it.
Does that sound good to you?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Whatever he said we need to follow
since I you since I'm using my phone somehow I can here forest so.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : You can still hear me Right,
okay. If I'm ever a little hard to hear. Feel free to tell me to repeat myself. I don't mind at all. Okay, so right here, the first question was reflect on your past six months. What are you most proud of and why. And you said I am most proud of myself the most that I am proud of myself the most that I have acknowledged how much I am lack of my english skill in speaking and I have been intensively feeling of the need in constructing mature english as to confront my weakness, which is linguistic ability. I really love that you are using a lot of advanced vocabulary in this sentence. What really needs work with the sentence though is just your structure and a few grammatical errors. So I'm just going to paraphrase it how I would write this and then we can talk about why I did it that way. Okay, my computer glitch to little bit, so hopefully lets me do it this time. So when you're answering a question, especially when you're writing, I believe that it's always a good idea to include part of the question in your answer. So that's why I would begin this sentence with reflecting On the past six months,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : No, but well I can't see anything. So with the phone I'm not supposed to see anything. Right?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I have never done a meeting on a phone, but I'm assuming that since the screen is so small, you probably aren't seeing what I'm typing. But at the end of our session I will write an extensive feedback report with all of my feedback and like my reasons for correcting what I did. So you can go log onto your computer later and look at my responses.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Okay, so I usually don't get it. You're not fixing the the answer</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Yes, I was going to paraphrase your sentence.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : my sentence with my sentence. I didn't write anything.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : You didn't write anything.
What? I that is so weird right here. It says Wrangler's response</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : no that's not that's not my answer. That's the
I think that's another student answer, son.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : okay, well thank you so much for letting me know. This is about I've done a few of the tutoring sessions and I've never had that problem before, so I'm so sorry about that. I'll ask.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I was just confused.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : no problem. Thanks for bringing that up to me. Okay, so I'll ask you this question now, reflect on your past six months, what are you most proud of and why</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : that's excellent. What what am I most proud of
I'm proud of. I I just told you that transport to a different company. Another company I moved from construction company us consulting point. This is the one thing that I'm really proud of because they said decision of getting out of my comfort zone.
So although I got off from this company several years ago I couldn't take that offer because of my poor english. About six months ago I decided to move I mean get out of my comfort zone. so that's that's the most proud thing. that would be cool.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Right, I love that. My brother is an engineer and she has been working at the same company for a while and he doesn't really like it. Maybe one day he'll do the same as you and get out of his comfort zone and move to a different company and okay,
you're three month thought was very cohesive and I did understand everything that you said. I think I missed a few parts while I was typing but I tried my best to get everything. Some parts were just a little bit quieter than others, so forgive me if a little bit sore miss thing. But you said I am proud of transferring to a different company. I moved from construct construction company. That's the one thing I am really proud of because the decision is getting out of my comfort zone. I couldn't take that offer because of my poor english. But about six months ago, I decided to move and get out of my comfort zone. That's what I'm most proud of. And I do believe you said something before. I couldn't take that offer because of my poor english. Although I wasn't able to quite hear that part.
Okay, so we can go in here and just kind of paraphrase what you said and talk about what okay can improve. Okay, so, I'm gonna improve these first couple of sentences and kind of combine them into a larger sentence. So, I would say reflecting on the past six months, I am most proud of myself for getting out of my comfort zone transferring you. It's fine company. What I just did here is I think that it's always a good idea to include part of the question in your answer. So, that's why I said reflecting on the past six months, I am most proud of myself for getting out of my comfort zone by transferring to a different different company. I just wanted to make what you said a little bit more concise. So that's why I decided to combine these three sentences into one sentence and that is a way of working on those long sentences like you want to instead of having these small chunks, we can combine them all into one thing, but still make it cohesive and readable. Do you have any questions about why I paraphrased it in the way that I did.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I can understand that but since I can't see anything the typing so it's it's kind of hard to</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : No, I'm so sorry, I wish that things were different. I know that this is going to be a challenging lesson for sure.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : keep track on. Thank you. it's my fault. So I
locked in with another my company lapped up.
I announced I can check
what's the writing. No.
Yes I see your face with my my my phone and I check what you're writing here with my company.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : well there you go. Look at you figuring out solutions.
Okay, and then right here you said I couldn't take that offer. I'm assuming you were offered a job and I just didn't hear that part because you cut out for a moment, so all I heard was I couldn't take that offer, so I'm pretty sure did you say that years ago you were offered a job by the company you're at now?
Okay, sounds good. So I would paraphrase this by saying years ago company I am currently working but offered a position however cute two. My let's see if I can spell this word. Okay, I did spell it right, okay, deficiencies and english. I was unable you accept the position if you I was unable to accept the position and I'm assuming that now that you've accepted the job you feel a little bit more confident in your english skills then you did then.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : No no no no. What Not at all.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Not at all. Okay, I completely understand that I'm trying to learn spanish and I feel like I'm awful at it. So I completely get having that lack of confidence.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Well I don't have to use english at work because I work for korean major companies. That's why they offered me a job several years ago. But I I turned it down because anyway it's a international company global company so I didn't want to transport to this company without the ability to speak english you know?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Yes, I completely understand that.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : so now I'm the only one who's not comfortable in english but nobody thinks that anybody is uncomfortable english that's making me even more uncomfortable you know?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : No, I completely understand but to be honest with you, I do understand everything you're saying you are articulating yourself very well and I know how challenging that is to do
in a language that isn't your native language. So that's something to be proud of. Yes.
I don't know. It can be very frustrating, especially because there's so many rules in every language. It's hard to keep up with every rule that you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : the problem is that you know I'm becoming a different person when I speak english because I'm becoming I don't know a little boring</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : It's hard to convey your personality in a language that you aren't fully comprehensive of. It's very hard.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : in a this is really so so it's really hard to express myself well but I still use english with my
in the meeting, we all the meetings on a regular basis with them
the they're consistent working abroad
american consultants british european consultant
at the I'm just worried about or if they they think the for think I'm a stupid even while working as a consultant in korean
that's a that's the one thing that I'm concerned about but</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : that's a very reasonable fear. I know that my mom, she originally has speaks Arabic, she's from Egypt and she has always talked about how she just prefers for me to talk to talk for her in social situations because she's afraid that people will think that she's dumb because she's not able to articulate herself in the way that she wants to sometimes. So you're not alone and I assure you that a lot less people think that you are stupid than you think. I'm sure no one does.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : and my company started working together with facebook and Microsoft and I were as good as the others and I would apply for bad project
work together with american consultants and then learn a lot from that. no I didn't</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Yes, it is a long process to gain fluency in a language. It's a very it's a day to day battle. You have to practice every single day. Listen, doing what you're doing now being on this website. That's a step. So,
I'm sure that you'll get to a point where you don't have those same thoughts about how you're sounding when you're speaking in english.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I just moved anyway even with the same problem
but when I when I turned it down turned it down I I thought I was gonna improve
english enough to work as a global consultant but that didn't happen so anyway I moved so I'm proud of, proud of that decision</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : You should be proud of that decision.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : from the field I couldn't feel the sense of growing at a stuff that's why I felt comfortable
but since I transport to this company
I feel the sense of going
right I'm really happy with thanks happy and</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : that's awesome. I'm so happy for you. And when I was reading this sentence, the only everything that you said made complete sense, except I just decided to say years ago, the company I am currently working at offered me a position if I understood what you were saying correctly and then however, due to my deficiencies in english, I was unable to accept the position. So I just worded it in a way that was a little bit more structured. It went from point A to point B to point C. Without any repetitive of repetitive nous because there was a little bit of repetition going on and I just negated or I didn't include the part of you saying I decided to move and get out of my comfort zone again because you already said that. So I just decided to not include it in my paraphrasing.
Okay, do you have any questions about that or does that all make sense?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : it all makes sense</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Sounds good. Now. For would you like to choose the question that I ask you next? I don't have to go straight to question two. I can do anyone or if you want to not answer any of these questions, we can also just talk about something else if you want. Speaking practice, it's all up to. You really</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : but I don't mind I but I I gotta take what kind of christmas. We have here. So I don't have any preference
because I I haven't checked all the questions before, before the class. So</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : It's all good. I completely understand that you have a job, you're probably very busy. I completely understand. So,
since we don't have a lot of time left, I'll just ask you a quick question, Let's go with How far have you gotten with your new year's resolutions for 20,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : my new Year's resolutions. Well I So one thing one I already told you about this. I
I I I had the plan to I made a plan to this company, That was the biggest one so I did and the other resolutions at the moment</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
You said the other one was what?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : very very minor resolutions going on a diet since I've gained a lot of weight come. so obviously failed, I failed so so I was aware of the fact that I'm I didn't even start losing my weight so I bought a bike and started riding a bike with my wife and to lose my ring
who have and 1 1 another thing is becoming to become fluent in english but I couldn't study english very much because I since I transferred to a new company, I was busy adjusting myself into
everything here so so now I decided to begin with the Ringo two. To improve my english. That's probably all right, and that's really cool. Good. What other resolutions that I had?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I think those are good resolutions, biking is always good for you and obviously you have career goals. Okay. Looks like we only, Yes, this is a 40 minute session and we started at 6 30. I'm so sorry that you were late and we didn't get a
I know, but I feel bad because I know you didn't mean to. So I since I don't have time to paraphrase this here, I will paraphrase it in the feedback form and then explain why I did there. if you ever want to have another lesson with me, I would love that. Especially if we can have the whole 40 minutes. So maybe I will see you again. But it was lovely meeting you.</p>
