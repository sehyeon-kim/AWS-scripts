ch_1 : Hello How are you? Okay. Okay Can you see me? Okay. Okay. Can you see the document with the notes? Okay. I'm not sure. I don't know. I know it depends a little bit on the tablet or on the system but I know I've had some students who were able to see them both on their tablet. I don't know it's possible that it depends on the type of tablet you have. I don't know really. That's okay. sure sure.

**ch_0 : I, I realized that there's no camera in the desktop. So just,
and I think today, you know, just go with this**

ch_1 : that's okay. Well so we can just speak using the zoom function and then I'll write some stuff down in the meantime and at the end of the lesson I can share my screen so you can see the corrections

***ch_0 : totally okay. Thank you.***

ch_1 : and of course you can always access it after the lesson too.
All right well it's good to meet you. I'm Rosina.

***ch_0 : right, La la Xena
you can call me Patrick.***

ch_1 : I'm I'm from the U. S. But I live in spain now and I've been here for the last three years Working as an english teacher.

**ch_0 : spain. So what time is it then?
Thanks. really thought. it's different. here here I'm and live in Canberra Australia.
now it's like nine, nine o'clock**

ch_1 : how long have you been living in Australia?

**ch_0 : it's like, it's been like pretty long, like eight years, 7, eight years.
But yes, personally, like I felt like I need to study more english because I just leave.
I just a little bit, feel ashamed to say that I live in eight years in here, but like I can speak like this because**

ch_1 : I'm sure your english is a lot better than you think.

***ch_0 : It's still, it's still like, like be big challenging, challenging.***

ch_1 : Yes I know it's definitely a process a long process.

**ch_0 : Cause I'm like, I'm paying here like when it's really like grow up like training eight, I came here. So like, it's hard to get learning the english when like get older and learn english. I think it's more like height or harder.
It is my excuse. Sorry,**

ch_1 : it's much harder when you're an adult. It's true it's the Children who move to a different country when they're maybe eight years old can pick up the language much easier than adults.

***ch_0 : we, pastor is here. But***

ch_1 : Is there anything in particular that you want to work on?

***ch_0 : about like class. I mean,***

ch_1 : I mean in terms of like your english, is there anything that you feel like you really need to focus on or any specific advice that you're looking for?

**ch_0 : because I'm still right. You know, I can't, I can communicate with people
and I can understand and I can say, I can talk, I can say, I can speak what I want to say, but, but still, there's sometimes like, you know, it's like they still like then is I don't know it's hard to there's not many chance to face the place to experience the real english. You know like because they know they look they can see like see me that they know I'm I'm from like other country
so they use easier language you know that's like
like sometimes slowly and sometimes it's like the easier they use like easier way to you easier english. So like it's okay. But sometimes like you know when I'm talk on the phone
or like sometimes they don't know who I am and then they just speak like when they normally speak to the local like like in english speakers like
it's i it's pretty hard to understand.
So you know on it I don't know what why it's what what makes it harder like is it because they put like idiom or I don't know. Alright so**

ch_1 : Do you mean like the phone conversations are harder?

***ch_0 : baby that's like most difficult things.***

ch_1 : I think a big part of that is also just the sound quality is not as good and you can't read the person's lips
so those factors just add an additional challenge.
And also I think
it's often a pain talking to customer service people on the phone in general for anybody, nobody enjoys that. It's not a pleasant conversation to have.
Usually it's because you have some problem like
you need to change your flight and the website won't let you something like that.
So it's usually a kind of a difficult conversation to begin with and then add in the extra challenge of the sound quality from the phone and then
you know, you can't actually see the person.

**ch_0 : And when when like like when we do like face to face conversation,
when they when they see me and they like speak louder it's lower like they have to say consider care they like I have to say I don't know like**

ch_1 : they notice that I'm not a native speaker and they take that into account

**ch_0 : but like they normally they normally don't speak like that they use a bit lower voice like smaller voice and and fast, not quicker, like faster and I think that's your real, but when the phone call, they speak like that like quickly.**

ch_1 : they are probably just trying to speak more clearly.
clearly. because it's true, like for example if I'm talking to my friends, I might really mumble and not pronounce words very clearly but
based on the context my friends would understand but I wouldn't talk like that in a ringo class for example.
but it it's not it's not necessarily a bad thing I think as long as you're I mean unless
I'm guessing that they're probably not slowing down as much as you think because just talking to your english doesn't seem like it's at a low enough level that people would feel the need to really talk to you very slowly.
I feel like they probably are just trying to avoid
mumbling things like that, trying to avoid
maybe some of the more specific Australians language words.

**ch_0 : Right. You know, I'm working in the kitchen like I'm a sheriff, like, you know like when I worked with like the Ozy like Australian guy and then they just be like its mumbling, mumbling and then
or making jokes. Yes. So I don't get example, I went many times. I don't get it like it's hard to catch it. So I mean whenever that happens I I feel like, my God, I need to study most like so that's my goals or something to understand.**

ch_1 : well for the listening practice I recommend podcasts or tv shows without subtitles. And ideally something. So if you really want to understand fluent well not not just fluent but like fast english you could look for a conversational podcast because some podcasts that are based on news or that are more informational that have presenters that speak more slowly, they speak more clearly because it's like a news show. But if you find
I don't know any Australian podcasts but I'm sure they exist. You can try googling some if
if there's a podcast that's just some people that discuss different topics then you can hear them and hear the way that they speak over each other and
you know because it it would just be the two native speakers in this podcast and it would be like you're listening in on a native Australian conversation.

**ch_0 : Keep listening. And then just trying to get used to it.**

ch_1 : just to because the more that you listen to it the more that you become familiar with the speech patterns and it becomes easier you start to recognize you know this word is pronounced in this different way when people speak very quickly.

**ch_0 : wow. Maybe I'll try Hopkins later.
I don't, I didn't like a recent little bit
Some of the podcast from like, like, like us one like
and like Conan O'brien or kind of thing.
But I haven't, I haven't Try to find some Australian one and even like I don't know they can use it like in like every day like daily conversation they used really different like there's a lot of bad language as well and I don't know if they, you know Australian like it's not accent but they they should make it every things you like short. But I don't I haven't seen any kind of language in like T. V. Shows or focus so
maybe I would try to find.**

ch_1 : It's it's definitely less common after the class. I can try to do some googling to find some but unfortunately it's less common just in the general media world than american or british english.
But I'm sure there is something that exists.

**ch_0 : And I and you also you came
it'll be help as well like thing.**

ch_1 : So I I know you you did select the topic about travel. I don't want to take away all the time.

**ch_0 : I just choose some like Because I I just choose some simple one. I mean like not simple.
Talk and this is.**

ch_1 : Okay. Do you want to switch to talking about travel or are you interested in continuing to talk about language?

**ch_0 : I. Sandy like. I don't mind anyway actually I don't mind. But.**

ch_1 : Since you've already read and you've already prepared a little bit, let's talk about travel.
All right. So what's the most fantastic destination or most memorable country you've traveled to?

**ch_0 : is that first question?
It's memorable. Okay. like I didn't too. before just just people when I come to Australia
still like it was 2 2 weeks. Both was Like for two weeks travel. But and he was like really really interesting.
because like every it was like it was visiting my uncle like my uncle lives in New Jersey and then
it was like one hour like I'm sorry one our boss like one part far far from New Jersey. New york. sorry I think my bread is done.**

ch_1 : That's okay. It was a one hour bus right away.

***ch_0 : Absolutely. It was months was.***

ch_1 : It's a one hour bus ride away.

**ch_0 : Well now first way. so like every single day I go to New like took a person and then got to new york city and work just work work work around all the C. D. And then come back at night the next day. Go again. and the the it's mostly interesting partners like it's very familiar to me because and I saw the city from like the movies or dramas I saw a lot of times and then
the time. it was unbelievable because I was in death seeing like industry in person like I'm working through the street. I can I think there's better expressions. like that's why I like very interesting.**

ch_1 : You can say walking down the street. I mean you can use just a stronger word like amazed. I was amazed by how big and magnificent the buildings were in real life
or you can say I don't know maybe it felt like I was in a film.

**ch_0 : magazine. I feel like that like I was in that view in landscape view scene like I feel like I felt like I was in that movie something. so like and I'm surprised that there's a lot of people there lot of buildings there that's nice and I think I like something like city traveling in the city rather than like
like countryside 19. Thank you**

ch_1 : you prefer traveling to cities rather than to rural areas.

**ch_0 : brutal area. I think I'm this kind of person like in the city again.**

ch_1 : Okay so you're not as big of a fan of like nature vacations like camping or hiking?

**ch_0 : Okay Like I'd like to I like I like some working I like the ocean you know the c.
but I haven't let's try I haven't done much like hiking. Yes. good go to the mountains.**

ch_1 : what do you think? I haven't done much hiking.

**ch_0 : I haven't done much hiking yet because it wasn't really like interested to me.
but I like to see the ocean to see see
sit down and it's good**

ch_1 : Did you go to the beach when you were in new york?

***ch_0 : let's say it was like,***

ch_1 : When when you were in new york did you drive down to the beach?
like if not in new york city but if you go maybe an hour south to Long Island there is the ocean
and there are beaches.
You can get some.

***ch_0 : really? No, I haven't, I haven't been there just like***

ch_1 : well maybe not on your next trip.

**ch_0 : maybe maybe. definitely. I'll go go back again right
Do you leave America?**

ch_1 : I well in spain

***ch_0 : I mean when you're in us like***

ch_1 : all right when I was in the U. S. I grew up in Houston texas and then I went to college in Virginia
but my mom is from new york so I've been there many times.
so all of my aunts and uncles and cousins are there.

**ch_0 : then you, you you can ask some different questions
where they, but did you go to Spain to teach you some?**

ch_1 : because to teach english but I studied spanish in college and I wanted to live abroad and I wanted to live in a spanish speaking country so I could use what I had studied in my everyday life.
so I found out about this opportunity. It's a program sponsored by the spanish government where native english speakers from different countries can get a visa to go teach in spain
and that's what that's why I decided to do it.

**ch_0 : so it's like big difference is it is so different from like living in us.**

ch_1 : there are a lot of differences I think.
Well I think for me one of the biggest differences is just the structure, the layout of the city because a lot of cities in America are designed for cars, so if you try to walk someplace it will take you an hour and you have to drive.
But here in Spain everything is much closer together and people usually walk or take the bus or if you live in a big city, they have the metro system.

**ch_0 : Like like my country like Korea, it's like,
in Korea I didn't really drive or something. Just walk or just take a or something. But in Australia like you can't go anywhere, you can't go anywhere with like without driving so far. So big,**

ch_1 : that's that's how most of the US is. There are exceptions like new york city is an exception. New york city is probably more similar to a big city in europe.
and then the other difference is that all of the european cities have architecture that is just so much older
these cities were just built so long before american space.

**ch_0 : Or they sort of like, it's like more like history come**

ch_1 : like for example there are cities that have Roman ruins cities that have buildings from the 1200s
But the us wasn't even a country in the 1200s.

**ch_0 : that's good. Like you're more interesting, interesting. I can take you history.**

ch_1 : I mean I've never studied it or anything but I just enjoy seeing it and
just thinking how beautiful it is.

**ch_0 : Spain also Spain was also my like, you know, there it was on my list travel
always because you know, I'm a chef and there's a good restaurant like I don't know, popular restaurant in Spain. I don't know, it's still, there's still, it's still running and the clothes or something. But I always think hard about playing a lot people.**

ch_1 : Really? Do you know what the restaurant is called?
Do you know what the restaurant is called? Do you know the name of the restaurant?

***ch_0 : the probably you know***

ch_1 : Okay I think I've heard of that.
I don't know, I've never been but it sounds familiar.

**ch_0 : it's like it's it's so popular like in may be right 10 years ago like it's very sensation now.
You know that the culinary like trends so fast.**

ch_1 : Right. the trends move so fast.

**ch_0 : Can you move so fast? So not sure they are still popular enough
things pain. There's many good food and good restaurants**

ch_1 : Yes. Very good for sure.
Alright and then so We probably only have time to talk about one more question from numbers two or 3. Do you prefer one or the other?

***ch_0 : maybe a christian's dream.***

ch_1 : So do you prefer domestic?
Do you prefer domestic or international travel?

***ch_0 : sorry question two. Sorry.***

ch_1 : Yes. So then how do you like to travel?

**ch_0 : I definitely like to travel by myself like work alone
without playing you know just just I didn't, I didn't, I don't really even like book the hotel until like I get there
and sometimes I like
I did many times I just go there and then just walk around the city and then find some, it looks like it looks interesting like place to like stay like find the thanks accommodation there and going. And then I was always, it was, I was always like that like after Kobe virus like I haven't done much like travel but
people I used to create like that and I didn't really like to go with the groups or guy or something like**

ch_1 : That's that's really impressive. I think
I would be very stressed if I traveled to a new city and I didn't have any place to stay that night.

**ch_0 : Maybe I always go some safe place maybe.
they just want to ask like how to like describe like I like to like is that is it okay to say like I like to trouble like in purse or just like, I want to say something. I wanna, I wanna say something like I like to go without plan. It's just like,
like to go there**

ch_1 : So in in purse would not be correct. What what are you trying to say exactly in like in person or?

***ch_0 : interest in purse. Like,
like in first. Like,***

ch_1 : yes I didn't understand b be careful with the pronunciation there. So it's not that a bit like you were saying like in purse,
like a purse, Like a handbag. So paul, pulse

***ch_0 : In purse. Offers different many.***

ch_1 : Yes. No it's the same word, it's just the pronunciation.
I didn't understand what you were trying to say.
I I heard the r sound so I thought you were saying like in person or something.

***ch_0 : Okay. Import. It's how to like
to l and r.***

ch_1 : Yes. It's it's a hard sound, especially it's it's hard when it's at the end of a word it's kind of you just have to sort of pull
your tongue back like

***ch_0 : Or or the are some
I need to prick***

ch_1 : So you can use the word impulse, definitely you can say I'm an impulse traveler. You can say I like to travel on impulse. I like to travel spontaneously.

***ch_0 : It's hardest in span, spontaneously***

ch_1 : All right, spun tane

**ch_0 : answering because this word I heard a lot of time, but how to use it like**

ch_1 : Spon spontaneous. Just means that you
do things in the moment. You know, you come up with a plan and you do it immediately. Like if you if you say,
you know, I want to go to another city today, alright, I'm going to book a flight and I'm going to leave tomorrow.
That's very spontaneous. It's not planned.

**ch_0 : It, that's very spontaneous.
That's what exactly I'm doing. Right.
Put it. Of course.**

ch_1 : in the last few minutes I'll share my screen and I can show you some of the corrections I've written and you can let me know if you have any questions. So let's see
Alright, you should be able to see my screen. Right?
Alright, so you said I little bit feel shame. So it would be more natural to say I'm a little embarrassed to say or to admit this.
So shame and embarrassed. I mean, you can use them both. They're similar words,
but I think shame reflects sort of a deeper feeling of guilt and embarrassment. Whereas
like you would be ashamed if you if you're guilty for example, you like if you did something
bad and you feel really guilty about it, you feel really ashamed.
But for something where if you just feel a little like
a little shy, a little awkward, it's better to say embarrassed. It's not as strong of a word.

***ch_0 : That's true. In embarrassed.***

ch_1 : embarrassed, You can say admit to use a stronger word because admit it's like,
you know, you're you're telling something that you don't want to say.
and then he said, I point here already grow up or grown up, which should have the end. A better way would be I came here when I was already an adult
or just I came here as an adult
when and then you can go on to form another sentence I was or just as an adult.

***ch_0 : Some of them, The shoulder is better memories.***

ch_1 : And then rather than I can speak what I want to say, you can say express, I can express what I want to say.

***ch_0 : It's class can express what I want to say.***

ch_1 : Or you can also say get across what I want to say.

***ch_0 : I can get across.
I don't mean to sleep.***

ch_1 : I can get across what I want to say any of these instead of speak.

***ch_0 : Okay. Let's get him.***

ch_1 : speak is just like saying words but express and get across referred to like transmitting meaning to somebody else, which is what you're actually referring to.

**ch_0 : Get to get across is like, like, like it's a language like speak something like describing something through my**

ch_1 : to to get something across means to explain something to make somebody understand.
So it can be talking about language, but it can also just be if you're trying to explain something that's a little bit complicated or maybe you're if you're trying to explain something to your child and they're not understanding. You can say like,
I don't know how to get across to you that you're not allowed to do that. Like
I'm trying to make it clear and you're not understanding.

**ch_0 : It also includes like, like drawing or just my motion. Same. Also I can say like,
well it just was like get across.**

ch_1 : Like to to get my emotions across. I mean I think you could say that. Like it's hard for me to get my emotions across to other people.
then there's not many chance to face to face experience the real english.
So I'm going to just rephrase the sentence so
you can say something like it's sometimes hard for me to experience
a realistic native conversation or experience or maybe participate in.
Because when Australians realize that I am not a native speaker, they tend to
speak more slowly and clearly and they normally would.
And then these we talked about so they take into account that I'm not native. So they try to speak extra clearly
and then lower smaller. So I think you want to just say they speak more slowly or more clearly. Something like that.
You can also say they enunciate more.
Do you know the word to enunciate?

***ch_0 : and I seen, I don't know. And then some***

ch_1 : Enunciate means to pronounce words clearly.
So the ox it of mumbling.

***ch_0 : Okay. And then saying***

ch_1 : like it's for example if
when you're in school and you have to speak in front of the class. Kids often tend to speak hello, my name is they try to they speak really softly and nobody can understand them and then the teacher can say you need to enunciate, you need to speak clearly so that we can understand.

**ch_0 : and like the lower voice that I want to say with low voices, like small, low volume, like talks like small volume, you know, there's small,**

ch_1 : They speak more quietly.
Or you can say they speak in a softer voice. So a song voices. A quiet voice.
A low voice means low pitched,
So like hi lo
for example men have little voices.
A small voice is kind of an idiomatic expression that's used to describe a very quiet high pitched voice.
Usually when someone is nervous.
So that like this is a description you'll see in books for example.
If the character is scared then it might say she said in a small voice which means she's saying like hon
like she's really she's scared.

***ch_0 : okay. so totally different from what I want to say.***

ch_1 : And then so you were saying that the accent but it's not the accent. You can just say the dialect.
They tend to shorten words.

***ch_0 : So there's no one saying dialect. Australian time. Like***

ch_1 : Well so my sense is correct as well but
accent is only referring to the sound like the pronunciation
intonation in the speech
dialect includes accent vocabulary. Other just general linguistic styles of a language.
So because because here you were talking about the accent but it wasn't really the accent. Like it wasn't the pronunciation
Like the dialects can include. I know Australians have a lot of unique slang words. So that would be part of the dialects but not the accent.
Okay. I'll go through these a little bit quickly. So we talk about this one.
Instead of I saw the city from movies you can say I recognized it from movies
or I had seen it in movies many times before.

***ch_0 : Okay. Okay. I colonized.***

ch_1 : Then you can say the view of the skyline,
that skyline is like that when you see that all of the buildings.
Alright. And then the sentence many times. I just go there. Okay, so like you can say many times in the past I just visited a city without any plans or without anything booked.
You're talking about the accommodation
walked around until I found an interesting place to say stay.
Some looks interesting is that's not grammatically correct. An interesting place to stay. A place that looks interesting.

***ch_0 : Let's start with the interns. Okay.***

ch_1 : All right. And then a couple grammatical corrections. When we have a conversation not do a conversation.
I chose the past tense of chooses, chose.
I've been to new york just before when I come to just before coming to Australia,
It was for two weeks travel.
It was for a two week trip.
Alright then past tense. I went to new york and then
it wasn't really interesting to me not interested.
And you can also say for example, it's not really my thing informal way.

***ch_0 : Was it? It was, it's not fair.***

ch_1 : Like I think you were talking about hiking for example, it's not really

***ch_0 : I feel like it's fresh.***

ch_1 : in general your english level is quite good. So you should try to when you go into these conversations try to just have the confidence that you can communicate. Even if you say some things that are not completely native,
you can still communicate. So just
the more confident you are, the the more people will
notice that and respond speaking more in their native like their their natural accent rather than trying to slow the speech.
And then as far as these new words or grammatical mistakes, just make sure to review them and then you can try to
fix them or incorporate the new words next time.

***ch_0 : Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the like overtime.***

ch_1 : No problem. Alright, have a good day.
Good night I guess.
