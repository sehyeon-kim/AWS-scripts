ch_1 : Hello? Sorry, I had a little trouble with the zoom meeting I think. Hello,
how are you doing today?

**ch_0 : Good. Good. Good. But there were technical problems
so I couldn't contact you.
So is it okay now?**

ch_1 : I think it's okay, everything should be fine now.
so hello, my name is Allen and I'm currently a student at Princeton University where I'm majoring in electrical engineering, so next year will be my second year, but I'm also mina ring in english and linguistics, so very broad interest and I'm looking forward to meeting you more today. So
you tell me a little bit more about yourself.

**ch_0 : I'm a middle aged korean woman
I live in So, And I need I need to learn more about english speaking. That's why I that's why I joined Ringo
and I think it's very nice. Very wonderful system which which enables to learn learn learn**

ch_1 : I think my favorite part is probably meeting you know, new people, so you know I've been able to meet little kids or professionals, so tons of different people from all different walks of life and that's been really really interesting to me.
So I looked in your specific lesson request and you wanted to know more about my experience with humanitarian engineering, which is something that I've been working on since high school. You also wanted to know more about new york city, which is a very interesting city. So yes, I will begin by talking more about my experience with humanitarian engine.
So as you know, I am an electrical engineering major at Princeton. but
in my free, in my free time I like to apply my engineering experience to developing new solutions and new devices for humanitarian aid purposes. So this is primarily to help people and to help others. So
can you see the lesson notes? Are you able to see it?
Yes. So if you look at the first picture, this is something that I've been working on for three years now. it is an exoskeleton for Children with disabilities, specifically
Children with cerebral quality. So I'm not sure if you are familiar with cerebral palsy, but I left the korean translation for cerebral palsy down in the bottom. So, this device is intended for little kids who have trouble with walking running, so who have mobility issues. So this is working on?

**ch_0 : Right. Right. Right. Could you could you speak slowly please?
Two? It's okay. It's okay.
I couldn't understand what you say but
it's a little bit please. A little bit slower please. Yes.**

ch_1 : Okay. Yes, definitely. Okay, so, yes, this is the device that I've been working on for a few years. And so what I work on specifically is I work on the electrical aspect.
So I developed the circuits involved. I also do some of these simulations, so I can show you some simulations later if you're interested. but that's something that I have been working on. And the second thing that I've been working on is known as a wood chip bioreactor. So oftentimes, especially in America,
there are these environmental issues known as algal blooms where we see a lot of algae developing in ponds or lakes. So this algae is very harmful both to humans and to the fish.
So this is a solution

***ch_0 : Excuse me. Excuse me. RG RG***

ch_1 : algae. So let me see if I can find it.

***ch_0 : R G. Could you put the the the the***

ch_1 : So I'm not sure.
I can put a picture too.

***ch_0 : I but looms I didn't know that.***

ch_1 : so this is a very, very large issue in America right now because of the amount of chemicals in the water. So these chemicals contribute to the growth of this algae over here. and this is the solution that I have been working on with Sweden the country and with Australia
and we implement these into local ecosystems and local lakes. So very interesting stuff. Do you have any questions?

**ch_0 : So you you are doing the I mean skeleton.
So it's it's it's good for disabled for the disabled. Right.**

ch_1 : Yes, just a little.

***ch_0 : It's really I think it's really really wonderful challenging***

ch_1 : Yes, this is correct.

**ch_0 : human human human for human. And another one is I think it's totally different from quasi skeleton.**

ch_1 : it is, it is very different.

**ch_0 : yes you you were interest your interest is. Right. Right.
So it's it's this is good. So you you you currently you
interested in the environmental issues? Right.**

ch_1 : Yes, this is correct,

**ch_0 : The swish in the water. So how can I pronounce our blooms.**

ch_1 : so it's algal blooms so you want to make sure you pronounce the el correctly. Yes algal blooms. Yes,

**ch_0 : Aigle brooms, brooms, algal blooms. Algal blooms means means
it's training I'm in the water water
water system watering system for the plant right?**

ch_1 : Yes, this is correct.

***ch_0 : so who needs who who needs the system***

ch_1 : so this system is mainly
yes, everyone, it's mainly used by governments which is why I've been working with foreign nations because if we continue to let this LG stay it will degenerate. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that word, so degenerate means to weaken.
So it will weaken infrastructure and pipes and it will release toxins into the water that are very harmful to people and to local animals. So this is something that the government has been funding and the government has been implementing.

**ch_0 : Alright. Alright it's awesome.
It's really really challenging challenging. How can I say challenging**

ch_1 : Yes. you can say it's a challenging problem

***ch_0 : challenging task, challenging task***

ch_1 : charging past, That's that's correct.

***ch_0 : I think you're clever***

ch_1 : So thank you. So even though it's very challenging, I enjoy working on it a lot
and my cousin actually who lives in Asia has cerebral palsy, so she is disabled,
which is the reason why I've been working on the first solution because you know this is an issue that is very close to me very near to me, so I don't mind working on it, I find it very enjoyable and you know anyway that I can give back to that community
is something that I will do and

**ch_0 : Alright well what what what what did you lead that kind of challenging?**

ch_1 : could you rephrase that question a little?

***ch_0 : It's a strange question. Right? Could you para price***

ch_1 : so let me let me try to, so what are you trying to what are you trying to ask

**ch_0 : What do you lead late what do you lead your interest? I mean the**

ch_1 : my position in this process? So

***ch_0 : what makes you what makes you,***

ch_1 : what makes you interested in these

***ch_0 : What makes you interested in is your right***

ch_1 : So what makes you interested? so why are you interested in these challenges or?

**ch_0 : yes yes yes that's right
that's right. Why are you interested in these challenges? Right I forgot many things**

ch_1 : so the verb here is interested, which is the one you want to look for

***ch_0 : I say I understand.***

ch_1 : I think the reason that I'm interested in these challenges is because I believe that we have to come together and develop solutions together
to the problems that we're facing I think it's very important that we are actively working towards solutions for these problems and I feel a sense of urgency, so this is why I'm working on these issues personally for me.

**ch_0 : Alright. In Korea there are so many concerns about bsg it means economically socially and environmental
environmental social so social economical governmental issues are everywhere we said E. S. G. System.
So every single company
has to has to to help you to kip
the rules of E. S. G. System**

ch_1 : I I know exactly what you mean. I've heard about the korean dsG system before. So one way that we can rephrase this
heard? See oops the korean government it's particularly concerned where E. S. G.
For environmental and social issues. So
your method your way of saying it is understandable but my way of saying it would be a little more formal and a little more fluent. So here we have concerned as the verdict we want to say the government is concerned.
Instead of saying there are many concerns because there are is very passive. So this is a direct relation between the government and these concerns
Because of the E. S. G. Regulations laws,

***ch_0 : All right good good good***

ch_1 : every single company has to But here so we're followed

***ch_0 : out here we're follow.
Better these rules. Okay.***

ch_1 : so the korean government is particularly concerned with E. S. G. Or environmental and social issues because of the E. S. G. Regulations law standards or system
every single company has to follow or adhere to these.
Does that make sense to you?

***ch_0 : yes. It's really, really good
but good perforating I think.***

ch_1 : So what do you work on in in Korea it's like what is your career you know what do you enjoy doing?
professor wow. Very cool.

***ch_0 : Yes. And as well as a film producer,***

ch_1 : wow. So what do you teach?

**ch_0 : and film producing. I produced, I've produced several feature films in the last 20 years in Korea.
I I have been teaching at the university.**

ch_1 : That is so cool.
Do you enjoy teaching,

***ch_0 : Yes. Yes. Yes, absolutely.***

ch_1 : wow that is so cool. I was considering becoming a professor so going into academia
my professional career but I don't know it's a very long road to become a professor in America and I really respect you for that. That is very very awesome.

**ch_0 : I I think you can you can you can be you you can be a professor because you're a topic. Your research topic is really really realistic, realistic
and future. It how can I say future received**

ch_1 : So you can say futuristic?
Yes that's a very strong word.

**ch_0 : and yes, and many young people
are concerned with environmental issues. So I think your your area, your research area is
for a future professor.**

ch_1 : this is very good very good response. So let me see if I can paraphrase this.
I think you can become
because you're research topics. So I'm gonna say topics
are very realistic, both realistic and

***ch_0 : Boss, realistic and futuristic.***

ch_1 : many young people are concerned with environmental issues.
This is a very very good sentence over here. Many young people are concerned with environmental issues. I really like that a lot
similar. I think your research interests
are suitable for a future and
academia you can say
so that's what you are, you work in academia which means research and college. You can say becoming
I think you can become a professor because your research topics are both realistic and futuristic.
Many young people are concerned with environmental issues.
I think your research interests are suitable for a future in academia or becoming a professor. Thank you for your encouragement.
That means a lot to me.

**ch_0 : So before before become before becoming a professor, I was with Samsung Electronics for nine years
and I was a manager. So I know I know something about business business**

ch_1 : that. Did you enjoy working at Samsung?

**ch_0 : yes, that that they they pay lots of money. They paid, they paid, they paid to pay for the money was high
Higher than any other companies in Korea at the time in 1990s.
And I I learned a lot from
from from the company because there are many men, there were many excellent colleagues so
I learned many things from. Damn.**

ch_1 : There's a lot of people that work at Samsung in Korea.

**ch_0 : Yes. A system. Yes.
The most, the most important thing is is that I met my friends?
yes. Yes. Still still we meet. three times a year. Moment Please. Moment please.**

**ch_0 : Yes, next monday Really I will stay there for four weeks
and I will meet my friends and
so I've been there before but now the travel insurance company called me. So I had I had to confirm my
my schedule. So okay.**

ch_1 : that is so cool. After after I finished editing this, I'll help you with your trip to Korea and talk about some places that you could visit. So let me work on paraphrasing this.
before my academic career I worked at

***ch_0 : All right. Your expression is really really good.***

ch_1 : So before my academic career I worked at Samsung electronics for nine years as a manager
a had a high salary

***ch_0 : that's why I go there. I went there.***

ch_1 : that was much higher than their competitors.
Moreover I learned a lot from the company because of my excellent colleagues. So I really like the word that you used to your colleagues, I think it's very strong.
However the most important thing is that I met my friends from Camp Stone even after so many years
three times a year
or even after so long we still need to

***ch_0 : so long even after so long. It's nice expression.***

ch_1 : so this is the transition word over here.

**ch_0 : Okay. Okay. Yes, yes, yes.
Nice transition. So I think I recommend you,
I recommend you if you have a chance to work huge company just do it.
You can meet your friends just do it**

ch_1 : Just do it. Okay.

**ch_0 : if you, if you don't, if you want to study more.
So I think you do better join huge company
for some time but sometimes because
you can see many things on both side of you.
You can see many things on the side view.
Well, I mean you can understand understand many things. The social system. No**

ch_1 : and the pay is good.

***ch_0 : macro macro macro, how can I say? No, you can't.***

ch_1 : so you can say a macro scale?
I'm not gonna scale.

**ch_0 : so so I think I if you have a chance to during he was completed state, so
two years or three years after that you can restart
research to your own topics.
So I think in Korea now now in Korea the universe, I'm in the Academia Academia 12 once professor who has, who has business, who has who experience, who has experienced at other other
other either areas or
so if you have a if you have a different experience
okay, I always say again in Korea, some academia's once to hire professors who has experience in experienced in other areas.**

ch_1 : areas. Okay sounds good.

***ch_0 : so chairs such as business companies or broadcasting companies, something***

ch_1 : that's very good advice.
I will definitely take that advice.
Also the pay at these large companies is generally very good.
So you know like Microsoft or google the pay is very very very

***ch_0 : Yes, yes, that's right, that's right,***

ch_1 : just like that sounds so
I would advise you to join a large company for some time.
many things from a bird's I. U. Perspective.
As well as the social system at a macro scale
if you have the chance to join, grasp the opportunity
so grass means to take, it means to hold

***ch_0 : I know, I know the word.***

ch_1 : let's see in Korea. Academia, her first professors
who have professional experience. So professional means working in companies
so professional experience particularly the business.
So does that sound good to you?

***ch_0 : You know my my my mind.***
