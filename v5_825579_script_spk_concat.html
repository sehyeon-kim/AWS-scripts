ch_0 : Hello. Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>ch_1 : can you hear me? Okay
awesome. Well nice to meet you. My name is Alisa. I graduated from the University of michigan where I studied psychology and asian studies
do you wanna tell me a little bit about yourself?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : sure my name is louis my name so my korean name is Jin Won kim</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Louis chin wan kim</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Yes I'm working for solar solar energy company in Irvine and I've been I've been working in the us for almost four years and then now I'm and preparing the interview of amazon amazon
to move to move. the company, I mean the kyocera is korean company, so I would like to have more
american culture company, I would like to work more american crucial company so that's why I'm preparing some movement for the time being.
And so I just updated unloaded my interview scenario
so just please take a take a look and take your time and then there's just only a two paragraph for now. So so I want to review this two paragraphs</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : let me take a look at this real quick. Okay, so
during my time at Q cells sales operation and logistics team were still managing it without systems. Okay, so is this this scenario where you're looking at
the sales operation for the que sale accu sales platform
and business is growing double in comparison to usual and you have extended channels, so it is not only more also more complex
as for challenges, stakeholders want to implement digital systems to boost their sales and you plan to analyze the operations process for 1 1/2 months in the product timeline. Okay so basically there's not enough time to complete the project to the extent that you hoped for.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Yes, so like stakeholders cooperation is was very important
for me to build up some system because the system should be a I mean it's supposed to based on on the search operations requirement, so I set up the time to gather their requirements for 1.5 hour, 1.5 months. But at that time like apparently like like Pulliam was growing fast so they had to focus they had to focus on a daily approbation, they couldn't make make to join the meeting to to discuss their requirement so but so that is my first draft so can you can you review and edit is more than native and then if there is some you know
miss we are difficult sentence to understand. always more.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. sure. just so I understand the context better. Is this what you're submitting for an interview or?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Yes. Interview So usually imagine they asked, they asked to get the interviewee
like What is your, if there is a type? Tell me about time if there is some tight deadline or without a challenge like that. So I picked up this case.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : or like a challenge. I see, I see. Okay cool. that makes a lot more sense to me. So let me just copy and paste these two paragraphs into the document.
my God, that's not what I meant.
I don't think I can copy paste this. Actually
yes, please thank you. Perfect.
Okay so for this first section let's take a look
so you are talking about in your situation when you're working for Q cells correct?
Okay. So as an m we can say as an employee employee at a few cells as an employee of Q cells sales operation and logistics clean. I hope to manage.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : No, that means they're they're doing
their operation in manually. Not not with not using system</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. So during my time at here so the sales operation and the diskettes team we're managing, what were they managing? What is it him?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So they, they still like using Excel's just email. There's no systems.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I see. What are you trying to answer with this paragraph here because you're just are you just giving context of the situation?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : so the question is hold owns</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. I think I think I understand what you're trying to say a little bit better. So this is one example of a challenge that you overcame, is that correct?
Okay and the challenge was that</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : kind of like this when you were able to deliver an important project under a tight deadline.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay that makes sense. Okay. So given what you have told me the situation is that this business is growing way too fast And basically the sales and operation logistics team weren't able to keep up with this operation with their operations because they were mostly doing it manually correct?
Okay. So then in order to solve this you develop this U. S. P. Development project.
Okay. Cool. Alright. Then we can say however given that business business was growing at almost double before and can you explain to me what you mean by extended channels?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : so at that time we are trying to expand expanded channel. So, so usually we just sell out to only one channel one this like just distributor channels. And then it's very easy and simple process
to get order and proceed, proceed order and logistics. But we extend the channel to like more downstream like more close to. And the user
there are like we have to deliver our product is very like like small amount of literary
because distributor they are purchased by like big volume but but more downstream to go to mean to reach out to more downstream there they want to have small amount of volume for orders and then you know like delivery is more complex max 10</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I see. Okay. In that case I can say we can say and so however, given that business was growing at almost double the rate than before and we had they certainly expanded it's the year range of our channels.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : every time I'm confusing what is the differences, expand and extend?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : really? Okay, so expand versus extend
given different context, they mostly mean the same thing,
but in this case when we say extend channel it just means to give the impression that you're making them longer.
Like imagine something's becoming longer, whereas in this case when I say expanded your
not just making it longer, you're using them more. So for instance let's say we have a string
when we extend a string it becomes longer we expand strings, that means we have more strings
so we have instead of just one string we have maybe five string and so that's expanding versus extending,
does that make sense?
Okay, so expand is increasing in both with and I guess
whereas extend is just lengthening,
does that make more sense?
Okay, cool. Alright, so however, getting that business was growing at almost double the rate than before and that we had recently expanded the range of our channels, our sales orders, we're not for me becoming or Lauren numerous also Laura's Halifax.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So I wanna I wanna explain the background
why I why I initiate the Q. S. P. Platform project.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : so you're setting up context. Right,
right, okay. And then, so after we set up this context then we can go on to say
in order to help
my team face these orders more efficient? I initiated AQ SP two, it's about mint project for the Q cells.
so altogether this will sound something like this. During my time at Q cells, the sales operation and logistics team were largely managing their operations manually,
however, given that business was growing at almost double the rate than before and that we had recently expanded the range of our channels are sales order, we're not own orders were not only becoming more numerous, but also more complex
in order to help my team face these orders more efficiently, I initiated the Q sp development project or the Q cells sales platform,
Does that sound okay for you?
Okay, awesome. and then the second part is what you're you're explaining what this project entailed, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : No I the second paragraph I want to say I faced some challenges because
compared to my schedule of this project and then I I located the I located a time for 1.5 months together stakeholders requirement then the other time I have so that so then I I could focus on the development system based on the stakeholder requirements. So that's why the time two discuss with stakeholders requirement is very important important to me. But there are there are there was challenges.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. So are you saying you wanted for the sake of your stakeholders, you wanted to limit your part? I don't know why this is. So for the sake of your stakeholders, you wanted to limit your project time to 1.5 months?
but You were only able to complete 60% of the project at the end of that timeline? Right
okay. so the challenge we faced was this time limitation, but do you have another section where you're explaining how you overcame this challenge?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Yes. Right. The next paragraph will be</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : okay, cool. I just wanted to make sure that that section.
Okay, Alright. So we can work on this section, person. So
that being said there were several schools while Simon implementing this project for one stakeholders. We're I guess stakeholders wanting to implement as usual digital systems to their sales and if you ever find that my wording is not correct. please correct me for like for your, because I'm not really
familiar with your sort of field
Okay, so wanted to boost their sales, but part of them had to deal with daily operations. What exactly do you mean by daily operations?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : so their responsibility ability is to manage their daily operations so like process or
you know like pick up troughs and then deliver, checking delivery ahead of him like that.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I see. so are you saying that they even though they wanted to implement your project, they they still had to deal with their current responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : so they can so they couldn't
put this meeting on their high priority</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I see. Okay, so
for one other stakeholders wanted to implement my digital systems project. they were preoccupied with daily daily operations and other priorities.
and then we can say, and then is the second part where you're saying this timeline, that's another challenge, right
separate from this. Okay, so another challenge.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : well wait a second. I mean this is that is now another challenge because they couldn't join the meeting about the to discuss their requirement.
That that's why I mean to to to understand and gather their requirement within 1.5 half months. I have, they have to, you know, they have to, let's say they have to locate like three hours per day to join our meeting, but they couldn't. So</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : So that made your timeline much longer than expected.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Yes. Yes. Yes. That's my child.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, Okay. I see. Okay. I understand. So,
as a result we were unable to we were unable to have consistent communication and discussed there specific needs. I had Originality plans to have to analyze the operations and or complete the project in 1.5 months. No effort.
You don't believe that?
given, given that stakeholders were unable to communicate their needs? Our project, I'm Ryan was extended beyond that's fine. on top of that there is not enough time to discuss topics. Okay, so this is what you were explaining.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : But like to meet the deadline, I didn't extended my deadline. I just gather their requirement only 60 60%.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : okay. So let me change this then. So however, given that stakeholders were unable to communicate their needs,
we were only able to, so you got there, so you're only able to incorporate their needs When you were 60% done with the project.
Okay. So we were only able to cultural there, their side of operations after Under 60% of the project. Okay, so all together, let's see how this sounds
that being said. There were several obstacles I faced while implementing this project for one, all those stakeholders wanted to implement my digital systems project. They were preoccupied with data operations and other priorities. As a result, we were unable to have consistent communication and discussions, sorry, discussions
of their specific needs for the project.
I had originally planned to analyze the operations and complete the project within 1.5 months. However, given that stakeholders were unable to communicate their needs, we were only able to incorporate their side of operations after over 60% of the project had already been completed.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : this is not project. I mean 60% I I gathered their requirement. I mean I need 100, I want to Understand 100% their requirement but there's no time to discuss about that. So that's why they just gave me only like or 70% of their requirement. So in that means, that means
without fully understand or gather their requirement. I just I shouldn't start. I shouldn't I
I should start only with the not I mean 100% requirement, not 100% requirement.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I see. Okay. So maybe instead of saying this, I can say we were only able to incorporate 60% of their requirements, requirements into the final project, does that sound like what you're trying to say?
does all of this sound like what you're trying to convey or is there anything else that you want to specify and change?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : No, I I just want to hear, I want you to hear your thought about our conversation
For 20 minutes. So I mean</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : So do you want to like just converse in a casual conversation or?
Just unrelated to the interview at all?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : No, I mean you can say anything about my english or the interview and my writing or my speaking.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, so I can just ask do you want me to just ask you any random questions or do you want me to simulate an interview and ask you interview questions?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : interview question is more</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I can do that.
Okay. in that case here's since we already talked about the classic, what is the challenge you faced question? Let's ask you
something more in the lines of what is something you think is your greatest strength?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So I will I will make a the finer the Richert later. But my strength is I think given the list requirement, I I tried to I tried to meet a deadline and then I I tried to I tried to</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Are you trying to think of of the right word to say?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I mean I tried to make a requirement based the logical thinking, do you know what I mean? Because they just gave me a small not fully a requirement. So I can assume that there their requirement with my experience in the Q cells. But still I I didn't catch fully their requirement. Well I can I could I could I have to design, I designed this system the system to expand. We're scared up scared up very easily later once I get there there are additional requirements. That is one of the most one of the important competitive, competitive theses of product owners job. So that is my strength.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : So I believe you're trying to say one of your strengths is your ability to be flexible
when crafting this project. Does that sound like what you're trying to say?
Okay, so Miles. So we can start off by saying my strength is my adapt the ability and lacks ability, for example, when trusting this project, I was able to create a system that can easily be expanded or skilled up in the future
despite or and then we can say this for example, despite having limited access to requirements</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Let me take the next question.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : when crafting this project,
I was able to create a system that can easily be expanded or scaled up in the future.
and that's basically all that you need to say. So you give your opinion first and then you back it up with this example.
So that is a really strong answer in my opinion.
Does that make sense for you?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : but I wanna more additional conditional explain about this my set on my strengths because usually
There is a in in system development project. it's kind of having a full understanding of their requirement is very difficult because as I mentioned that they always focus on their
there are the first responsibility. And then like
so this this environment very usual in the store in the digital industry. So that's why. I want to emphasize with with given limited access to requirement or
where there's no enough time to devote time to project by trying to meet a deadline. That means I had to Understanding their business 1st and then with with without without full understanding. But I I</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : You're still still able to adapt around that?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : able to scare up and</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Right, okay. So maybe in this section we can add some more some additional details. So
we can say when presented with limited resources and requirements I am still able to two just really system you I can still, I'm still able to adjust my project two green. you've been quiet, does that sound does that sound okay to you
or do you want to add some more some more details in there?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I'm still just like product to that's good.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : and also I assumed that this question would be asked if you if they in the interview if they ask you the previous question of what is an example of a challenge you faced and overcame?
And you give this whole answer on your q sell sales platform project. I highly doubt that they would ask this additional question of what is your strength because it kind of overlaps?
so this answer doesn't need to be fully fleshed out like the previous one because it's very unlikely that you'll have to
go as in detail as the previous answer
if that makes sense?
Okay Do you wanna do maybe one more question?
Okay. In that case what sort of work environment do you like to work in?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : was sort of environment. So</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : What work environment do you work the best in?
So for example this could be in a very competitive environment or in a very casual relaxed environment.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : that's a good question. So in my experience I had a startup experience. And also I had big traditional company experience. So compared to compared to to company cultures. I prefer a work in a startup cultures because when I when I work in syrup the vision and mission was very clear and then all of employees only focus on the clear mission and version and mission and your mission and mission. And or so they the startup companies usually obsessed of set to customers. But but like big traditional companies they are they are focusing on the making a profit. And like big and traditional means they usually doing business various various business, they're doing various business. So they, I mean it's it is hard to focus on only one mission or to focus on the customers because they want to make a profit like this, this business and this business and this business like that. So
in so and okay</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. No sorry I'm sorry keep going,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : the okay and then the second one, that's why is that given that the environment, 2nd 1, the most differences, most differences is is speed, speed. So like startup they can, they are no, they have very fast press speed too. The bear of something up developed the program or life system like that. But I mean in traditional companies they are with you and review and review again. So the spit to make something new is very slow slower than,</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : This is a wonderful answer. One thing I will, one tip I want to give you is if you find yourself comparing two things. So in this case we're comparing startup versus a big traditional company we can use compare and contrast sentences to cut down on a lot of filler sentences and make our words more concise.
So I'll show you how to do that real quick. So we can start by saying
in my experience, I thrive in start up environments and then we can start our compare and contrast. So
we can say something like unlike big traditional companies start up companies tend to have very clear missions and goals. All employees collaborate together to reach a third so or to reach a shared and that's what and then you can go on to say the focus on customers. So
on the other hand, traditional or we can say large company unions tend to focus less on customers and more arms making a profit. They just Times two Resource in a very slow paced environment where constant reviews and fixed on needed. In other words I paid for start of environment
as they are fast pace
or fast thanks customer oriented.
And I'm very clear
so altogether this will sound like this. In my experience. I thrive in startup companies. Unlike big traditional companies, startup companies tend to have very clear missions and goals. All employees collaborate together to reach a shared vision.
On the other hand, large companies tend to focus less on customers and more on making a profit. This tends to result in a very slow paced environment where constant reviews and checks are needed. In other words I prefer startup environments as they are fast paced, customer oriented and have very clear goals. So the format of this is like this. In my first sentence we give our straight up opinion
and then we use our compare and contrast sentence structures with with transitional expressions like unlike or on the other hand and so this allows us to emphasize the difference in these two
and then in the very end after we give our reasons, we sum it all up. we some of our main points
in this complete sentence so it rounds up our whole answer in a very well completed answer.
Does that make sense for you?
Okay. Unfortunately we are out of time. I will go through the ringle docks and make some more additional corrections for you so you can also look at that in your own time. But Do you have any other last questions for me?
Okay. Okay. Cool. Well, it was nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Thank you. Nice meeting you.</em></strong></p>
