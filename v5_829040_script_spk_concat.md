I see here that you chose a discussion focused lesson.
With even pretty even we speak The same amount 5 - five.
And I see your main areas of focus are fluency vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation.
You want to paraphrase english to make it sound more native,
ask wanted to follow up questions and also paraphrase to make it sound more horrible,
does that sound good to you?

***ch_0 : that sounds good to me.***

ch_1 : Okay so sometimes when I'm doing a little lesson I'll try for a paraphrasing focus lesson, I'll try to write down as much as I can of what you're saying
Which I can try to do today if you like or if it's more discussion focused, I can just make notes and paraphrases that are a bit shorter instead of like everything.

**ch_0 : I think of prep placing
it doesn't matter for me literally I mean you can do which way you prefer I mean which way easier for you so**

ch_1 : sure but your main focus is discussion either way.

**ch_0 : it could be on 5-5 or you know the 8-2 or 73 doesn't matter to.**

ch_1 : So today I see that you chose the lesson about travel in France I guess traveling to France.
So have you been to France before?

**ch_0 : Yes I've been to France because my oldest sister lived in paris I went to see my sister and her husband was to travel that's just a family visit. It was an amazing experience. Paris is an older city which is a variety of attractions including V. G. M. Facilities and the famous detail power.
your city was like a museum and I love this unique and sophisticated atmosphere. I was not interested in artists or drawings. People. I traveled paris however after watching and learning about great artists is in paris I studied to have an interest in art and in addition little is to say food was so great and France is well known for their food
and everybody knows that but it was my it was beyond my expectation even though I get bread from typical local bakery was very tasty.**

ch_1 : what was your like favorite thing that you did in paris?

**ch_0 : I can't just pick one. So basically food was really great. I mean because I'm a bread lover. So I normally try to explore the best bakery or on my town
or even on Manhattan I'm in the city
but he this spread from local bakery in paris was very much better than you know the famous bakery in the United States. So that was the good thing for me and also everything that I tried was just so great. I mean you know just like local full were foot from this fancy restaurant. I mean everything was just great**

ch_1 : That's great. Are you a big food person? I definitely am too.

***ch_0 : you know. I am foodie.***

ch_1 : I think that's always my my personal favorite part of traveling is just

***ch_0 : same for me. Same for me.***

ch_1 : always the of course you love to see attractions, but in the end the food is what I'm most excited about.

**ch_0 : that is the the most the biggest religion I think that's the biggest religion to travel. I mean you know the objection plus food.**

ch_1 : it's really you can just
get such a feeling for the culture of a place or you know the people through the food too.
And of course it tested.

**ch_0 : I believe you've been to paris right, you told me you went to travel europe for eight months right**

ch_1 : Yes. Well I was doing working remote, so I was staying for one month in like different places. I didn't stay in paris but I have gone
It's only for 24 hours.

***ch_0 : I see, see you know.***

ch_1 : Yes, my my cousin was visiting me in Prague and she said let's go to paris at the very last minute. So we went
but it was wonderful. It was beautiful. Like you said,
we mostly just went around and ate.
My my my cousin loves she studied like
Petesch E eight, like
pastry in in school.

***ch_0 : Okay. Okay. That's cool.***

ch_1 : So she really wanted to try all the pastries. So
we did mostly that in the Eiffel Tower,

***ch_0 : Okay. Okay. Sounds great.***

ch_1 : but it would have been great to visit the art museum because it really was such a center for art
back in the day.

**ch_0 : But I believe 24 hours so it was not enough to enjoy the whole city. So I think definitely you need to visit again.**

ch_1 : No, I don't think so. I would love to visit again. I found the people a little bit rude, but I think that's just because if you're a tourist, maybe they're not

**ch_0 : Normally you know the european people are
little more A little more loot 10 people here I think you know.**

ch_1 : I think so too.
there, I think americans are really
smiley and friendly naturally. I think we're just taught to be that way and then Europeans are a little bit more

**ch_0 : That's right Yes Right.
when I went to the restaurant, I mean I felt like this server, I mean the waiter or whatever, I mean I feel like
I'm giving you food, this is what you want do, I also have to give you a service. I don't think so, that's right,**

ch_1 : I don't think so. I don't need to be nice to you.

***ch_0 : I felt that late so***

ch_1 : I felt that way too. We were sitting in the restaurant just waiting for to order for so long just trying to wave the waiter and they were,
but the food was amazing when we did get it. So

**ch_0 : I know, I know that's why we pay for the food and you know, even if there was no service anyway we ate the restaurant.**

ch_1 : Is service important to you when you're going to go eat somewhere or

**ch_0 : I used to but not anymore, because I'm from Korea and then Korea is
like very very service wise country, I mean because of this the politeness culture so you know sometimes I feel like it's
too much, I mean this service is too much too nice to people tonight, the customer
but so because I'm from Korea and service wise country, so I used to thought about this service very importantly, but not not anymore since I lived In the United States states about almost 17 years now, so
doesn't matter, you know?**

ch_1 : Right. Did you move to America as a,

**ch_0 : I went to college in South Korea for two years and after that
I completed my military duty for two years**

ch_1 : Right. For two years.

**ch_0 : right after the military duty I came to the United States especially to go to college, I was a transport student that time, so you know once I graduated I was able to get a job here. So since then you know I have stayed in this country you know for a while.**

ch_1 : What? a long time.
do you go visit Korea very often?

**ch_0 : people Covid yes people Corbett I was able to visit Korea or for my
personal proposal and also I had a chance to travel by business so you know I went to visit south Korea Maybe two or 3 times per year so you know it
but due to this Covid I haven't I haven't had a chance to visit Korea for a while.**

ch_1 : Right. It's, it's a little bit more complicated.

***ch_0 : That's right, that's right***

ch_1 : hopefully maybe soon you'll be able to visit.

***ch_0 : probably on the end of this year.***

ch_1 : for some like New Year's holiday or something.

**ch_0 : I will avoid a few years or something because normally
that time of decision the flight price is really high so I will try to avoid that time of decision.**

ch_1 : that's true that's that's a that's a savvy move
I forgot about that. Well what's your dream destination now that we're able to you know travel a little bit easier after the past few years?

**ch_0 : Okay. One of the destination I want to travel is the pioneer national Park located in chile. You know they say soaring mountains and blue icebergs from clear from pleasures and also grasslands.

because sometimes it could be a little dangerous just hiking by myself because you know there are also why the animals out there like especially a black bear or panda style. And also it could be dangerous because you know once you get
injured her then you know someone needs to help me. So you probably need to like so mountains or top trails then I'll go with hiking boys and boys from hiking.**

ch_1 : it's great. I didn't even know that that sort of certification existed. That's really cool.
So do you have any travel tips or even hiking tips?

**ch_0 : Okay. Well the european countries First of all
I direct recommend search in occupants where you can buy a sim card. I will continue to advise in part at the airport or travel destination because it will allow you to use the internet. People actually travel begins.
you may use loving service from my experience, grooming was always more expensive than just buying a simple
so since google maps worked well in europe countries and everybody got used to it. It will be an excellent guide for your trip.
Google maps provides not just a direction but also very detailed information of public transportation.
So most of major cities in europe such as paris London for Barcelona system because there's always a heavy traffic condition in major cities. Taking public transportation is faster and should provide to get to the popular tourist destinations
and additionally always be prepared against pickpocketing when you travel european countries. Pocket happens everywhere in european countries since the swamp people getting
can ruin your whole chief baker plan in other events against
anti pickpocket. been buying an anti pickpocket. Pocketing travel bag could be a good option. This bag is generally made of
our anti slicing perfect. And every zipper is protected with a clip this prevents to open deeper easily. And also always put your credit cards and cards and other tribe deportation case. This case prevents pitching up the data in other BBB credit cards and I. D. Cards. In addition they will use a backpack. If you want to use a backpack with your back hand on chest side that you can observe your back in time. Leslie use a strip to protect your cellphone ceremony is always a good target. And if it's bonded over to steal while you're holding up on your hand. So you need to connect your cellphone with belt workforce by strip for protection. And
Leslie have a local tour. When you go to the vision of reality you may just watch the famous art piece and leave the explanation on the world. But if you go to the museum or gallery with your guide. She she will explain background and history about the artist and you can better understand about those art business and it will help you look for longer.**

ch_1 : it'll stay with you
I always love doing a walking tour.
it's a nice way to get your bearings and and
kind of know where you're going, Get an idea of the city.

**ch_0 : I normally don't prepare this packaging type of travel. I mean
You know the 12 it follows me every time I don't like that kind of stuff. So normally I just broke up by myself by myself and then just go to the destination and explored by myself and sometimes have a local tour when I need to go to the immortality is stay on provide good explanation about this art piece for scripture. So it will it's kind of interesting or sometimes fun so**

ch_1 : No. Right. and then you don't have to read so much at the museum, I love going to the museums but sometimes halfway through I'm just so tired of reading all the little,

***ch_0 : that's right. I know I know I know you know***

ch_1 : it's really nice the tour. I've never had a tour guide for an art museum but that's a great idea.
I've only done like a couple free walking tours
which is kind of nice but then I'm the same I'd like to explore on my own,
do it at my own pace.
Bye. so you you seem like you've traveled a lot

**ch_0 : I did. I did I've been told many different places in europe and you know in the United States too so
you know people called it I had many troubles**

ch_1 : Is it for work mostly or

**ch_0 : for the domestic travel walk purpose mostly
but other countries like europe or out of East asian countries that was just for the vacation you know.**

ch_1 : When nice, that's lovely.
wait and one of your questions that you wrote you like to have a more active experience when traveling?
do you ever go hiking when you're traveling for pleasure

**ch_0 : I had a hiking so you know there are lots of good hiking dressed with breathtaking views so I really enjoyed hiking in Switzerland.**

ch_1 : in the swiss alps,

***ch_0 : that's right that's right***

ch_1 : wow, that's like the prime, the best. Really beautiful mountains.
And so what do you mean by more active experience when you're traveling? Can you tell me a little more about that?

**ch_0 : There's a good example of that explain that explains by active preference
on the business stream. I had a chance to visit the Cayman island in Caribbean. I had three days personal time after my walks casually stone
also my colleagues I mean they just stay at home, stay at home, they just stayed at a hotel and get little X. But I took this a school that class and you know eventually I was able to own this open water scuba diver certification in three days so you know
this is a good division.
I tried to I tried to be productive**

ch_1 : so I sometimes it's just nice
to have a memorable experiences because you can just relax

***ch_0 : I know. I know.***

ch_1 : so tell me about this scuba certification. What was that like?

**ch_0 : It will say a whole new experience. I mean I had a bad experience about this hiking but never had a chance to experience this underwater
experience. So it was a whole new experience and basically I like swimming so this was like the the is just important in my eyes I mean you know I was able to see this lobster and small shops and you know the total just swimming right next to me so it was like to just amazing and fantastic experience.**

ch_1 : I can't imagine. I bet that was beautiful.
certification process difficult but what was that like?

**ch_0 : It wasn't that the big but it takes time. I mean people you actually get this certificate, you need to pass the paper exam first. So you know once you has this exam then you need to have a indoor training over certain hours I forgot how many hours but it was like the four hours or eight hours or something. So once you complete both this paper exam and also in the world training then now you can you can go to the extra dive into the sea.
So once you complete four dives in the ocean then you will be you will eventually get satisfied
for the beginner you know.**

ch_1 : So what did that look like? You did it in three days? So

**ch_0 : I already finished it before this actual dive in the ocean. So you know people I went to the business trip, I passed it
exam by myself through the online
and then I'll I was prepared and I took the this indoor indoor class indoor pool class in Jersey. So I'll let it completed all this process before I went to the Cayman island. So once I get to the Cayman island I just did this four dives in the ocean. So
eventually I was able to be king.**

ch_1 : wow. So that was the, that was the plan. It wasn't just you got there. Maybe I'll do this, wow, that's that's amazing. What a beautiful place to to do your dives. Your ocean dives,

**ch_0 : that's the plan. that's especially this Cayman island is very is beautiful the coral lips and you know so the
colorful pieces over there. So I really wanted to try this one.**

ch_1 : maybe a bit more interesting than
Jersey shore or something.

**ch_0 : that's right I think I can't even compare I mean You know normally the color of this ocean is not blue or sometimes looks like brown or something injured. Sure. but definitely in caribbean is so blue I mean bright blue.**

ch_1 : My interesting fish. the atlantic, so blue. I think it's so funny that
the atlantic ocean, like all the beaches on the east coast? The water looks so
gray or it just it's so different. Why does it look so bad

**ch_0 : I know. I know. I know.
I don't know why but it's it's totally different. I know.**

ch_1 : I guess maybe because it's an ocean as opposed to a sea or I don't know what it is but
when I was traveling this year we were by
the mediterranean like a lot of the time
and that water is just so so blue.
So that's amazing. So have you gone scuba diving
since then? Since being certified?

**ch_0 : I was supposed to get an advanced certificate after this open water. The beginner sorted. Okay. But due to the carpet my plan has all stopped. I was actually supposed to go to a Philippine
to get the best certificate. There was some kind of course I mean
Maybe like the three day or four days course that I can't get this offense certificate due to the club. It my plan.
that's the bad. I know.**

ch_1 : Maybe in the next few years then.

**ch_0 : I will do that. You know you know once I just stopped by this clipping and take this certificate and I can go to the Korea
and then I'll visit my family and then you know I can't leave town.**

ch_1 : that you can do it all in one trip

***ch_0 : That's right. That's right***

ch_1 : so maybe that's your plan for later this year.

***ch_0 : Not this year but probably next year.***

ch_1 : Cool. Very nice. And where does your family live in Korea?

**ch_0 : my family lives kind of here and there. I mean my parents they live in Seoul south Korea
and my youngest sister also lives in south Korea. From my eldest sister. She used to live in paris but now she's in china because my brother in no work
I mean their lawyer discussed him to the china for a while so they live in china now and then by the second sister she's in texas with the
person Mumbai nephew and also my needs she goes to school in indiana so basically our families like the there**

ch_1 : Do you often have
It's like a big family reunion or just visit each other one x 1

**ch_0 : Because I have three sisters so and we are all here and there so it's not it's too and be united all this family so it's not easy so I just say go visit it's family member you have a chance.**

**ch_0 : Not really because I work from home so actually I wanted to work in the office maybe once or twice per week
but none of my team members I don't want to go back to the old test so I didn't have a choice I mean**

ch_1 : they won't let just a few people come. It has to be general consensus.

**ch_0 : Normally I mean my employer gave us a choice based on the
team based I mean if this team decided to work from home then the whole team needs to work on him or
if this team decided to work in the office then the whole team is working in the office.
that was our choice. But I don't know. My team members wanted to go back to the open so

ch_1 : Little little active vacation.

**ch_0 : that's right, that's right
you know just some laying on the sun bed and having cocktail,
it's not my thing I mean I can't enjoy maybe for one day but once the overall day then we get to work so
I need to definitely find this objective kind of stuff.**

ch_1 : Well thankfully in, I feel like in upstate new york, I don't know about New Jersey, but there's just so many national parks or you know

***ch_0 : That's fine. That's fine.***

ch_1 : forest, you can go to

**ch_0 : As you know, there are nothing in Jersey. I mean, georgie's just georgie, you know, just listening to radio. not much stuffs in Jersey.**

ch_1 : Not really, not many national parks or anything

**ch_0 : I don't think so. No,
it's a small state, you know. And then,
especially neural Jersey, I mean, this is just a kind of legislation area for a commuter to happen. That's what I think.**

ch_1 : Right. I could see that for work.
Cool. Well it was really nice talking to you today. I just included a couple paraphrases
into the Ringel notes
just like a couple of corrections, your,
so like, you know, fluid in speaking, there wasn't like a lot of corrections or paraphrases that I did, but there were a couple of things like vulnerable to steal, it would probably be like vulnerable to being stolen.
and then I think for this one it will help you recall longer, totally fine, but I feel like something more natural could be, it will stay with with you longer.
I feel like people say that a lot.
Cool. Alright, well do you want me to include anything else in the notes after the lesson?

**ch_0 : yes, if you can, I mean, you know, one thing you leave my answers and if you find some kind of editor or
some kind of awkward expression, then, you know,**

ch_1 : in the, in the written answers,
sure I can definitely do that. It was really, really well written, but I can go back through and if there's something, maybe a different phrase, I can definitely include that.

***ch_0 : Yes. if it doesn't bother you, please.***

ch_1 : No, not at all, not at all.
I can definitely do that.
Cool. Alright, well it was very, very nice talking to you today.
You two enjoy your day off.

**ch_0 : enjoy your rest of the day and thank you for your lesson today, so hopefully I can see you again.**

ch_1 : Thank you. we're in the same time zone, so that'd be cool.
All right. Thank you.
