<p>ch_1 : Okay then. What what kind of crazy things did you do?</p>

In in 30 minutes like me and my friend were like talking that we should go somewhere we we can't just stay in library forever so I said like let's go and let's book a flight ticket. So we booked the ticket in that
In that moment like it was only it took only 30 minutes for us to book a ticket so it was kind of crazy I think</strong></p>

even 20. I don't know but I was just like should I do it? Should I do it? I'm gonna do it and it was it was for a few months later but it was still like
spur of the moment. I didn't really think about it. I just kind of was like why not? I'll just</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : It's that's right the time I don't I don't think about things I don't think about my future or I just think about that moment so that's why
it's really fun thing and great thing to do things like that.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : No it was really cool. I did you have fun?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I was I really had fun actually I went I went to trip with two other friends so it was all four of us and we, me and my me and one of my friends were just called

<p>ch_1 : my gosh that's fantastic.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : it was so cool</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I want I want to do that a little more? I need, I need to, I haven't done it in a while. It's just a little more difficult now than it was before because I have a cat now,
so I have to make sure that I have someone to feed her.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : No that's important thing
so you're leaving alone.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I do not have roommates, which is very, very beautiful. I think it's a great thing.
I had my friends stay with me over the weekend just because she she was staying in our friend's house, but then the landlord came early and kicked her out. So she needed a place to crash for a few days until her flight home.
So she was staying with me in my small apartment
and it was fine because we're like good friends. But also after she left, I was like, that's much better. I,
because I had, I had cleaned my house like completely right before she got here. And then when she left, I was looking at the kitchen, I was like, everything's dirty, it's so dirty.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : don't know. I understand</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : but it was, it was, it was cool. I might, I don't know, I might live with I've been looking at places to move and I would be okay. I would be open to moving in with some of my friends,
but I don't want to move in with strangers. I think I've, I think I've had enough of that.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : so you're living in us.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : no, I I live in italy.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : so good, I was planning to visit to Italy like my my plan was like going spain first and go to Italy and Portugal it was like but

<p><strong>ch_0 : I was planning to go two in Spain what was it the capital of the country's?
Madrid and I actually wanted to visit that pose a tunnel in Italy.
it was it's really it was really beautiful in the pictures so I really wanted to visit the tunnel and but only I can I only saw it through the picture and it's so sad.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : okay, I've never been but I've heard that it's really, really gorgeous, like it's definitely on my list of places to go.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I it's so cool.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, so now what about, what about Singapore? You just went, you said you just went there for vacation? Right,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I've been there like five days and actually yesterday I've been to the Universal Studios Singapore.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : they have one there?
I didn't know that.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : they will. they have one in Singapore and it was I wrote most of the attractions and like three of them we're very good because I enjoy writing attractions. I enjoy
roller coaster thing so
three of them were like that. It was it was really cool. I also bought like express ticket so I</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : so you can cut the line.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I I caught line and it was very like thrilling because I saw people standing in line and I just just go pass through them and it was cool.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, very nice. I like it. So Universal Studios in Singapore, do they have like harry potter world or it's only like the normal movie, like supreme stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : just ignoring anything normal thing and there was there wasn't no harry pottery had like transformer and Star Wars like that</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Are you, are you really into like the Star Wars or Star trek series or like the Avengers and superhero movies or anything like that or? Not really?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Well I I enjoy Avengers superhero movie. I watch every Avengers series in the movie theater.
I enjoy watching this series in big you know big screen.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : okay, nice. So how did you feel after the end of the last movie,</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : the last movie was the what was it, the wonder thing what's the movie called?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : the I think it was Avengers Endgame right?
Or in whatever that last one was with Thanos?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : some some people say that Thanos is kind of coronavirus.
that's two points. so I heard that some people say that corona is autos.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I don't know it's movie and the real life is different so but it's funny thing to say that.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, I don't know, I don't know some, I remember some people saying that Thanos is trying to do a good thing because by eliminating half the population or whatever, it would help heal the planet? Like help with sustainability climate change and all that,
did you, did you kind of
take that angle or did you only see him as a villain?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I cannot like I think I agree with both sides, I cannot judge actually because that also makes sense because people are hurting the earth,
the environment agree that people are like hurting the environment, the earth environment
and but it's not but it's not okay to eliminate people
You know how can I it's not it's not a good not good. It's not I think it's crazy thing
to think like that but at some point we should save our planet. I think that's the that's that's the result. Save the planet</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : No. Okay, so which was your favorite superhero movie</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : same friends I I can't choose one because I enjoyed every movie but how about you? You enjoy superhero movies or</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I don't, I don't like a lot of action movies, so like my boyfriend wanted to see what's that new one, Top Gun?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Top Gun? that was</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : he wanted, he wanted to see it and I was like, I don't really like the big action movies where it's literally just, they go out and specifically they're just going out with their guns and shooting and blowing things up. It's not not very it's exciting, but it's not very interesting to me, but I do like the superhero movies a lot and I thought the Avengers movie was good, but I also really loved venom. Is that that was good?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : that's good. but the top on is really
great movie. I think you should go watch with him.
it's so, it's not, it's not about gone and it's about so I don't want to spoil, but</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : it's okay, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I think you should go and watch it. It was, it's worth watching it in the movie theater. You should watch that in a big screen.
Really enjoyed watching it. I want, I want to watch that second time but enough time. So</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Did you ever see the first one? The old one from like the what? Nineties or eighties or something?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : actually I saw it after watching the 2nd 1 because the second, I just heard the short short summary of the first one
And I just and after watching the second movie, the new one. I really got interested in that series. So I watched the first one but I got back home after watching the second movie.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, I've done that before too, Like
the first or the second one was so good. I was like, let me see the original.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I don't, so I was the original one after watching the second movie.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, which one did you think was better?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : The first original one was really great. thinking of thinking of the ear that the movie was made, it was like 40 years ago. It was 30, 30 years ago. But the equality was so great.
but I really enjoyed the 2nd 1.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Who? Okay, would you say that you are a movie buff?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : kind kind of because I I really enjoy watching the movie in the big screen. So I really enjoy going to the movie theater. So I think I, I think I am,</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, so what is your all time favorite movie?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : my, my favorite movies have to, I can choose one between them. I have like three or 4 favourite movies
You know like Rachel Mcadams, it was in the movie and it's kind of time travel thing. I'm not sure you have watched it. It's really great.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : no, I haven't seen this one. Okay.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : then you should watch with your boyfriend. It's so good.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Okay. Okay, cool, what else?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Yes, about time and again again, have you watched it? The song movie mean musical movie, can I say?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I mean it's the musical</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : begin again was so good. I think those three and look as well.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, awesome. I I haven't really, I actually have not seen any of those because I'm a terrible person at watching movies. like I have a whole list of all the ones that I want to watch, but I just never do it
because I don't, I don't know, I also, if I do watch a movie, I tend to watch scary movies. I find them very exciting.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : You're watching her movies.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I love horror movies.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : wow. Because I don't, I, I really don't enjoy watching scary movies. I hate scary things. So</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : gosh. I mean, I understand for the longest time. I was very strongly and badly affected by like any kind of ghost or demon movie. If I watched it, I would enjoy it, but then I would have nightmares for a month afterwards.
Okay. But I, I, I fixed that I forced, I
got really tired of it because I wanted to watch the movies and enjoy them and then go on with my regular life. so I literally, one,
one day I just decided I'm going to binge watch ghost movies until it doesn't freak me out anymore. So I did that with paranormal activity. I watched maybe like
I think there's four or 5 of them. I watched all of them over the course of maybe like three nights and it wasn't like three days, like literally I would watch it after everyone else had gone to bed
and I just did that until, until it
desensitized me. So now I get scared when I watch the movie, but then I go home and I can sleep like a baby, so</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : wow. To enjoy hurries, wow,</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : it's it's fun? It doesn't, it doesn't work out very well because most people that I meet don't like them,
although my my best friend does like them. So that's that's fun.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : It's good to have friends that can enjoy movie together.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : So are you very much into like K content movies or not really? Like did you see parasite? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I enjoy watching korean movies as well. And I watched parasite, but it was scary though. I hate blood.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : All right. But it was scary.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I don't know you watched it or not, but it's who blood thing at the ending. So</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : that was that was intense. I was I was so shocked.
I didn't really think it was very scary, but I was like, like totally unexpected.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Yes. And it's, I hate blood. So</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, so you really don't like gory.
Yes. Okay. Gotcha. So when you, when you watch like the movies and stuff like that, do you tend to watch it all in korean or do you do it in english?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : if I watch Korea movie, I I just watched that in korean and if I watch english movie, I actually turn on the korean subtitle,</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Is that because it's just easier for you to understand or you don't feel like confident in your english abilities?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : it's more comfortable and it's also fun to like, compare like for example if I understand some sentence in some way but the subtitle says in different way so I enjoy not enjoy but I sometimes compare my thoughts and the subtitle.
sometimes I don't understand why the translator translated that sentence like that.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Do you, do you think that ever helps you learn more?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I think it helps me. Two. I think it helps.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, cool. I also, I tend to I tend to watch shows so I'm studying italian of course since I'm living here. but I tend to watch shows with english audio and italian subtitles for the same reason because then I can kind of see how it might be translated how it might be written out and a lot of the time I'm also like
that's so weird. Why would you write it that way? But I think it has helped me because I am, I've picked up a lot more like you know like one or two word phrases here and there like exclamations that are very commonly used around me, I've been able to like pick up more on
like some of the grammatical or not even grammatical structure, just some of the like sentence structure
to feel a little more native, So cool, that's good.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : have you, have you been learning italian? Like
how long have you been?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : only since October so I've lived, I've lived here since August, no September 2020.
But I moved originally to study to do a Master's and my program requires you to pass a language proficiency exam before you can graduate.
So I I did spanish because they required two years of study but I was only at the school for one year,
so I did spanish since I had a background in it and it was only after I was able to like finish all of the proficiency requirements that I started studying italian,
so so it hasn't quite been a year but I think I'm doing pretty good so far because I'm studying on my own, so</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : that's cool. So you're doing like english spanish and italian</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : no I cut I cut spanish out,</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : is it difficult to learn?</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : no it's not really difficult to learn, it's just so when I was in undergrad, I studied spanish and japanese together and that was okay.
But when I, when I first got here I was trying to study a little bit of italian alongside the spanish and that was it was just a mess, it was a big mess because they're too similar, so I was always confusing
spanish for italian and vice versa, so for me like I think I'm gonna I'm gonna get back into japanese this summer and start studying again, but that'll be easy because they're so different if it's if it's too similar like italian and spanish like they're similar enough that people like Italians can just go to spain and talk with</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : It's a lot similar.
I didn't know that.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : So even even when I was studying in, even when I was studying spanish
if someone didn't understand english, sometimes I would use spanish instead and they would
get the gist of what I was saying.
so I'm like I can't I can't study them together because they're too similar. Okay.
But okay we only have a few minutes left, let's go ahead and do some lines of corrections in paraphrasing starting at the top here, you said I had to write the dissertation in Korea and I had to attend the class in Korea. So that's fine,
the only thing is instead of the I would say my make sure you're using plural is here and then we can also cut this down a little bit and say
I had to attend my classes and right my dissertations from or in Korea,
you said the time was different from the U. K. That's alright. You can also say I was in a different time zone
or even I was I think you're what nine nine hours ahead of the U K?
Then you said that I cannot experience some kind of things in Korea. Okay. So I I cannot explain that I cannot or can't is good. All right, okay. so I regret that there are some things I wanted to do but now can't do them since I'm in Korea
or I regret the things I missed out on when I was in the UK.
Okay then you said the culture shock was bigger in Moscow, that's fine. You can also say I had more culture shock
in Moscow or even I experienced more culture shock in Moscow. I made a plan for a journey across the europe after I finished my degree, so take out the, make sure this is past tense. You can also say I had plans to travel europe
Alright and then you said when I'm here right now I'm regretting things, I couldn't enjoy more. I'm regretting the things I couldn't enjoy more. You might also say now that I'm here, I have a lot of fomo for the things I should have done more,
you know promo Right
okay cool. As for the rest I will put in the feedback notes because we are over time but did you have any questions?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : No everything makes sense.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay cool. Well it was really nice to talk with you today and I hope you have a good evening. Okay.</p>
