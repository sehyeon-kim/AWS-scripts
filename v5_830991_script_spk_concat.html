ch_1 : How are you doing?
Hello, how are you doing?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I'm doing well. How about you?</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I'm doing well. It's nice to meet you. My name is Katie and your name is</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : My name is Simon.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : nice to meet you Simon?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Of course, of course I have korean name but this is in english class.
So please call me Simon.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : sounds good. How was your weekend Simon? Did you do anything fun or just kind of relaxed?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : have you been Korea before?
No, nowadays the Korea is a summer decision
and then this decision is very humid
and very hard so I am struggling with hot weather.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : it's pretty hot here. I don't know if it's as high as Korea but definitely enjoying the indoors and staying in the A. C. Rather than being outside.
But in terms of this lesson, I see that you selected discussion focused.
So in terms of how many times we stopped for corrections and which like when we stopped for corrections, what is your preference for the structure of the lesson?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So my earphone condition is very not good. So
sorry to bother you.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : No, no, no problem at all. you had said you wanted a discussion focused lesson in the lesson request.
So for a discussion focused lesson, how do you like them to be structured in terms of how often you want to stop for corrections and when you want to stop for corrections during the lesson?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Actually I do not understand why are you talking about? So please say easily.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : So do you want to discuss corrections after talking about each question
Or do you want to talk for the majority of the lesson like the 1st 25 minutes
and then save the rest of the time for going over feedback and para phrasings?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I'd like to choose number one.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay. Sounds good. And you want to talk a little bit about some of your english goals and what you're looking for on Ringo.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So my goal is I'd like to my english level up
so so I'm a person who is still working with international people. So my headquarter is located in the state
because of that. Sometimes I need to have
few conference call conference calls with the foreigners
at the time. I I always think about my english ability at that time.
Always I'm talking to me hey Simon, you need to study more, you need to study focus, you need to
level up then now. So I'd like to I don't like to from my english skill more than now.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : that definitely makes sense we can focus on, you know, fluency, expand vocabulary, pronunciation, things like that.
Is there anything else I should know? Or do you have any other requests before we get started?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Okay. a place to be a person like a friend. that's all.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : We can start with question one then. So why did you choose this topic for today's class discussion?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : as you know, I'm a businessman and then I'm the order of
espresso bar. So that's why I wondered what kind of marketing strategy
the readable company used.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : definitely, since you're like into business, it'd be interesting to find out. But after reading the article and hearing about their marketing strategy, what did you think about it?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : after leading the article you can talk more. Okay. Now I understood that your remaining.
So actually their marketing strategy was very amazing.
they have sword, sword just coffee and drinks
before readable. There are many many of and coffee drinks but
the research are totally different.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : definitely. Red Bulls are very different from like coffee or tea. So it kind of
changed the way people might think about caffeinated drinks since there wasn't much of a energy drink market before Red bull.
Do you prefer drinking coffee or do you like drinking energy drinks?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I totally I'm a coffee man. And then
as I told you I'm an owner of the as first bar the coffee shop.
So I'm a coffee lover. So I prefer I'm free I'm free for the coffee.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : do you have a favorite kind of coffee that you like?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I used to love the hand the poor of coffee before but nowadays
fall in love with espresso
with a little bit of the sugar. I need a little bit of sugar on it.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : definitely. when you drink coffee, do you drink it for the taste or do you drink it for the caffeine and help wake yourself up in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So every I have a daily routine after opening my store. So
I proved I extract
four cups of four cops over Espresso
and then I taste it and then I feel the coffee
to wake up perfectly.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : So do you feel like it's pretty much like an instant, like just within a few minutes you can feel woken up or does it take a little bit longer? Like maybe an hour to feel the effects of the coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : No I did not understand, I didn't understand what we're talking about.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : so when you drink coffee,
how long did it take you until you feel more awake
or that you feel the effect of the coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Okay I understand around 10 minutes.
usually americans they prefer the americano were
brew coffee Or two days coffee from Starbucks. So the thing is the mix up with a little bit of the coffee and the water
but the espresso is a very teeny tiny beverage so too many coffee including the one of us who are very similar but the leader so
then next me wake up very fastly.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I don't really drink coffee like at all because I don't really like the taste
and then so I don't really know much about coffee, but then also I didn't want to drink caffeine and become like, I need caffeine to wake up in the morning.
but it always smells good when I walk into a coffee shop, but I don't really like to taste a little bit too bigger for me.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So I have a concussion to you,
so when you go to Starbucks or other coffee shop, what kind of beverage do you pick?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Normally I don't really go to the coffee shop since I don't like coffee, but I do,
if I do because me and my friends want to go there
order like tea or any like the other drinks, like juices, like the pink drinks from like Starbucks.
But I try not to get Starbucks as much because it's a full of sugar, so it's not really good for you.
But they always look I like the look of coffee. It's very pretty. It's all mixed in with the cream and the milk and things. But</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I have one more question to you so you are not a copy person but to take a</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I'm not a coffee person.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : conversation with your friends, you go to some
t store or other place
places you can sit down and for taking a conversation with your cruise or friends.
So where do you prefer to go?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : even though I said
I don't like Starbucks, I have a lot of sugar,
I like to go to the boba, even though that has a lot of sugar but I think since it tastes better to me it's worth it.
But I like going to like a bobo shop or just go to like a restaurant to eat some food.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : boy shop Okay I see.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : and then just a couple of corrections you would say their marketing strategy was very amazing. So here
it sounds, I think it's a little bit awkward to say very amazing but a very common word when describing marketing strategies is genius. So the marketing strategy was genius.
That sounds a little bit a little bit more formal rather than amazing.
And then you said before Rambo there are not and he said not many cough caffeine drinks but the results are totally different. So when you say the results are totally different, just mean it affects you a lot differently than the current
caffeinated drinks that were on the market previously.
So I guess just like what did you mean by the results were totally different.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : The richard, I mean before readable there are many companies so
I have a one example in South Korea.
So there is one company, the name is the podcast. The thing also coughing beverage
but when I think about when I compare podcast and the readable the result the money they can take
the money that the company making the companies are Ernie
the money amount of the money is totally different when they compare to company Red Bull and then the korean company's cost even though they're the tasters are similar
and then they're they are sailing same topic of beverage. That thing is a coffee and drink. But
june is it making sense?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Yes. So you're saying that before Rebel, other energy drinks didn't do as well, but Rebel was a great success compared to other
caffeine drinks. Is that what you're saying?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Yes and then before Red Bull entered in Korea the podcast was the number one company
we're sailing coffee and drink in south Korea in my country
for a long time but after rentable entered my country the number is to change it rideable and then
master and then blah blah and the</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I see so you could say like before Red Bull there were other energy drink companies
but Red Bull was much more successful than the other companies.
and then you had also said that the taste I taste the coffee. To wake up perfectly.
So it's just a little bit awkward to say
wake up perfectly. So we can just say
I like to start off my day with coffee.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : let's just start off my day was coffee.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I could say coffee helps me wake up</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I have a question about the first paragraph
so in order to make a sense when I say I'd like to start with the coffee hold a second I'd like to start I'd like to start
my day with coffee without off.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : you could say I like to start my day with coffee. That's also perfectly fine,</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Okay thank you that.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : awesome. Good question. and then he said the coffee including one ounce. So makes me wake up very fastly so fastly isn't a word. So we can't say fastly
and also to make this sentence a little bit more clear your message rather than just saying the coffee is small. Or just only one ounce. We can say
Since the coffee or since the espresso.
It's only one ounce.
It is very concentrated. Or you say the caffeine is very concentrated.
The caffeine is very content
concentrated. So it makes me wake up very quickly so quickly rather than vastly.
And then you said for taking conversation with your friends. You can't really take conversation but you can say
to catch up with your friends or to make conversation with your friends.
Catch up with your friends or to make conversation with your friends.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I don't have more.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : moving on to question two, what did you learn from this article?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : the genius marketing strategy from</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : And what did you think about their marketing strategy or why you think it's so genius?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : they having made good good story lines with just the only energy drink. So the topic the energy drink is very simple and manual people think about this when you give readable the company the topic to many, many people and then I think there are only minority people think about this kind of story line. So because of that I think the readable had and then have the genius a marketing strategy.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : And when you say a minority of people think about this kind of storyline,
what do you mean by that? Do you mean that not many people knew what rebel was or not many people knew about energy drinks back then.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Hold a second. I think many people like Ordinary people
when I ask about coffee and drink they just think about coffee and drink is just coffee and drink.
But the reservoir company and then the monster company,
their competitor even though the simple topic they put a lot of story lines and the marketing thing and then
with just a simple beverage they from this from the simple beverage, simple thing
they married the people for love.
They made the people they made people to buy the product. Okay.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : that makes sense. So they associated rebel with many other sports or different ideas
even though just the energy drink itself is simple, they connected to things like extreme sports or being more productive.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : the thing is not easy. So when you drink coffee and drink you can imagine about extreme extreme sports.
They totally connected. They have connected the beverage with sports. The thing is amazing.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : definitely. I think that's a great marketing strategy to expand their market because maybe a lot of people wouldn't drink energy drinks or like you said, they did mostly just think of coffee when it comes to caffeine beverages. So this way they can expand their market by associating their brand with multiple different activities.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I have a okay. Yes you really you like and then when they, when people buy their product they feel the value on it.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : definitely can help them
associate their brand with many different parts of their life.
but in terms of a couple of corrections, you had said they have made good storylines with just only energy drinks.
So here it's a little awkward to say storylines, it doesn't really fit here because storylines is more involved when talking about a plot of a movie or like a tv show the story in there. So here we can say
they made a good, you could just say like marketing campaign
with with only energy drinks He said the topic of energy drink is very simple. So here again topic it's more having to do with like themes in the book or in a movie or a tv show or like article but since we're talking about energy drinks you could say Yukon
except of energy drinks is very simple.
So concept more just like the idea of them and like their purpose and then you had said when you give Rebel the topic too many people there are only a minority of people who think about this kind of storyline. So here you can't really like give the topic to people but you can say when you introduced rebel to the public,
when you introduce red to the public there are only a minority of people who and when you say think of this kind of storyline just mean are reminded of sports or what do you mean by think about the storyline?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : This is harder to explain but it deserves
serious harder to answer actually</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : So I guess are you saying when Rebel was first introduced to the public? Since there's not much of a market for energy drinks or since not many people knew what energy drinks were at the time? Not many, not many people thought of like I guess when people throw the caffeine they didn't think of energy drinks they got a coffee. Is that what you mean?</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Actually I don't understand you perfectly.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : so when you say people, not many people thought of this storyline
did you mean when people think of caffeinated beverages, the first beverage that they are reminded of is coffee rather than energy drinks.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I mean in my humble opinion there are in my in my business area there are few standards men
even though they are selling the same product.
Okay some good keeps cave the value with the product product and the value together to customers but some bad bad or no more salesman's are they just sell only product without value?
So I wanted to talk about this thing to you.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I see. So maybe people just sell the energy drink itself and say, it gives you energy,
but Rebel did something different by associating energy drinks with sports or productivity.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Yes you're right. So so I mean when you give in the public and
make them sell it,
ordinary people just sell
just beverage. But the reliable company were good salesman, they sell
product with the value. So.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, so people refers to the companies rather than like the public person who's buying it?
I see. Okay, so we can say when Rebel was introduced to the public, there's a minority of other
ener energy drink companies,
companies that were and selling
or or that we're associating there, there verges with
set with something I guess we'll just stay with productivity and
t and extreme sports.
So when Rebel was introduced to the public, there was only a minority of other and your d drink companies that were associating their beverages with productivity and extreme sports, so they just sold the product itself, didn't associate it with anything.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : So I think the rideable is laudable and then and Starbucks they are having very common thing about good marketing strategy.
So in South Korea there are many korean coffee shops, french coffee coffee franchise,
coffee franchises in my country.
But the coffee print charge hit up hit up and then hit up around 10 years ago. But
like 2000 2013 the in Korea the coffee franchise
Bloom blooming up but after 10 years later only
Starbucks and then coffee bean and tea leaves survived
So so why they are surviving when I when I I always think about that. What is the secret of them? The thing is good</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : We're definitely having a good marketing strategy, so you can stand out
from your competitors is very important, especially when the market is oversaturated or there's a lot of competitors who are doing it basically the same thing as you.
Well I was looking at the sentence again and I think it's best to change it to when Rebel was introduced to the public, They stood out from their competitors by associating their beverages with productivity and extreme sports,
it sounds more smooth. And then you said the thing is not easy. I think he said easy when you drink coffee, you think of extreme sports. So here I think instead of saying the thing which is a bit general and a bit vague so we can say
it is not easy to
coffee with extreme sports
it's hard to be reminded,
it is hard to be reminded of extreme sports
when you drink coffee.
And then you also said what is a secret of them? So here we have to change it to what is their secret? It sounds more natural.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : What is true? Okay.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Also do you have any questions at all?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Watch so before last last lots of paragraph. So you
you told me it is hard to be reminded of extreme sports when you drink coffee. So
please check my sentence in my head. So easy making sense.
It is hard to be connected of extreme sports when you drink coffee. Is it making sense?</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : it's, I think the phrasing is a little bit awkward but you want to use connect that verb, you can say it's hard to
connect extreme sports with coffee.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : hm You're hard to connect.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : But associated I think is the best word or the most fitting verb when talking about brands connecting like something else to their product.
So associated. So that just means like when the customer drinks it, they'll be reminded of all these different things or if they see that thing they'll be reminded of the brand,</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Okay, Ok making sense.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : awesome. Do you have any other questions</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I don't have more.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : awesome? Okay. also relating to their business strategy and how they had their famous saying like Red Bull gives you wings?
even though it's very successful for them and they're able to sell a lot of rebel too, like maybe athletes or people who like to do extreme sports. the article mentioned that there was one person who filed a lawsuit against them because they're saying it was misleading
to say Rebel gives you wings. So what do you think about the lawsuit?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : actually I read the paragraph or the article but I don't know about russell.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : it was like in the second to last paragraph
They said that one like customer in 2013 sued Red Bull
because they said that they had misled customers about the benefits of the beverage and they said that Rebel give you wings.
It exaggerates too much because it actually doesn't give you wings.
So I guess do you think the person was being like too picky, like just trying to find a way to sue them to get money or do you think their claim was actually reasonable and Rebel was exaggerating the benefits of their drinks?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : You know the marketing to do a successful marketing, you need to put some lies or
some story that people or interested in.
So I think that the person is very picky.
The marketing is just marketing.
So the rubber company put fun story on
their beverage. I mean they did rebranded the rebranding
but the guy was too picky.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I think so too. I think everyone mostly knows that
your teachings are not that healthy for you and that Rebel gives you wings. It's just a saying it's not supposed to be taken literally
in America I feel like there's a big culture around lawsuits,
like a lot of people like to, to companies, no matter how small the issue is, even if it's the customer's fault, they might try to find a way to sue the company. So is there a similar culture in Korea or not so much?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Actually when I visited Chicago around five years ago and then I heard a story
from my friend who is still living in America
at that time. He told me about your story. So the story about war old woman who bond by Mcdonald's coffee.
you know the coffee is always hot when you order just hot coffee
but the woman sued the McD Mcdonalds
because on the cop there was no warning sign.
because of that. Without the Mcdonald's didn't write down any warning on their copy cop
because of that because of the little bit of mistake. The woman won by us</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : I heard that story also like a while ago when I was younger, I remember thinking, wow, that is so crazy.
Crazy have now all the coffee cups do have warnings on them like caution. It's hot. So her lawsuit actually had a big impact on how the cups were made.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : And then the If the warm one lived in south Korea my country
she didn't she didn't win.
when she when she fought when she you know the Korea is the
the americans bigger country then
Korea and then the su the lowest developed
what you do in Korea so</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : it's pretty crazy how it was mostly her fault and it's common sense that
coffee is hot but she still won the lawsuit which is I think
show us a little bit about like the american legal system and some of its flaws.
a lot of companies like they tried to cover themselves as much as possible and they don't want any like liability earth, they don't allow certain things that are normally like
it won't be that big, big deal just because they don't want anybody to sue them. They have to be very careful but in terms of a couple correct?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : sorry to bother you.
So nowadays I saw the su between the actor johnny Depp
and the actress Amber Hood.
the studios are very fun. So they
around more than five years but
This is a 2022 they fought they fight again</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : it's pretty crazy like suing each other for defamation for like lying about the other person even though it was so long ago,
but takes a long time.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : and then you know they did the live streaming on Youtube. the thing is the news made me very very shocked</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Did you watch any of the trial?</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : in my three no. actually I didn't but also from the newspaper.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : wow, it's crazy the news was so global
with the trial. but in terms of a couple of corrections you had said
you have to put some lies or some stories so that people are interested. So it's kind of sounds a little bit harsh to say directly say that companies have to lie because
it's kind of more like illegal for them to directly lie. So to make it sound a little bit softer, you can say in order to have a successful marketing campaign,
companies have to stretch the truth sometimes.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : what about you could generate?</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : you could say exaggerate as well. Sometimes companies have to exaggerate that would be perfectly fine. But he said directly like it's a little bit too like honest.
and then you did in the, if the women lived in South Korea, she didn't win. So here since we're talking about a hypothetical situation
that didn't happen, we can't say didn't win, which means like she actually went there and she wasn't successful.
So we have to use wood which is just talking about a possibility. So
There women lived in because she wouldn't have one.
But I do have any questions or last minute comments before. We just talked about overall feedback for this lesson.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : I'm good so I don't have a more question to you so I think it is time job.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : Okay, awesome. awesome. I think you did a really good job with pronunciation and fluency in this lesson. It's very easy to understand you and you really don't have like an accent, it's it's very natural sounding. And influence e I thought you did a pretty good job answering quickly and your speech was pretty smooth without any hesitations which is great.
I think the main thing that we have to work on in this lesson is mostly vocabulary. because sometimes using different vocabulary major message a little bit unclear.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : I put Cavalleri. Okay.</em></strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : But after you know asking you about it with more follow up questions I was able to understand you more clearly.
And then in terms of grammar just mostly just small grammatical mistakes with maybe prepositions or missing a few words but overall they're more minor mistakes. The big thing is mostly just vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>ch_0 : Okay. Thank you so much. So after you, after this class I need to study more about focus.</strong></p>
<p>ch_1 : No problem but your your english is still pretty good, just a couple spots to polish up on but overall still a very strong lesson. But it was really nice meeting you today Simon and I hope you have a great rest of your day.</p>
<p><strong><em>ch_0 : Okay, Have a good day.</em></strong></p>
